# ResearchSeminarHW2
In this homework I scrap, download, count, and analyze words from AppStore reviews for popular virtual platforms iteratively. 
Code in this work allows users to easily change the apps that can be analysed though simple dictionary editing.
I use reviews of US users for:
- Facebook
- Instagram
- Telegram
- Snapchat
- Wechat
- Signal
- Twitter
- WhatsApp
- Pinterest
- Discord
