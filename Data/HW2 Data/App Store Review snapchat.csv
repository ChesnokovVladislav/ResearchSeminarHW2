"I’ve had Snapchat since like the first time I got my phone (I know right) & I usually never had problems well I decided go on one my accounts things were fine I went to send a snap someone & it didn’t send for a long time (in minutes) finally I got it send like I was closing outta all my apps, closing it, retrying, powering off my phone everything! Finally I got it I was happy so then I post pic saying I was getting off the account go my main because I was bored on that so that toke couples minutes post & so as said I was logging out well it kept saying ‘connection error’ when my phone was fine & tried once more getting out & everything didn’t work! So I deleted the app as I was I looked at peoples reviews knowing I wasn’t alone so I got it downloaded & tried login same thing popped up like really!? So I panicked & came here so many thoughts ran threw my mind because that app was kinda the thing that I texted some people on if I didn’t have them on other apps..but all I’m asking Snapchat is to fix this one bug for everyone don’t worry about new stuff I’m glad what we got but the game but eh. I’m going keep trying & see but for now this is it :/"
"I was on snap and randomly it stopped working, which is per usual. I closed the app and went back on, but this time my camera was black and wouldn’t turn on. I went to my normal camera app and it was the same thing. It’s been over a day now and my camera is STILL broken. I tried resetting my phone, I deleted and redownloaded the app, I  have tried everything. Now, this could be an issue with my iphone. HOWEVER, my friend with a Google Pixel had the SAME thing happened to him after he used snap! His camera broke and everything, which makes me think that snap is causing a glitch in my software. PLEASE do something to stop this, it’s very inconvenient and I might have to get a new phone if it doesn’t fix on it’s own. 

Snap has a lot of features that are completely useless. The games? Little icons that show up on certain locations on the map? Stories you can subscribe to? Endless amounts of filters? It’s too much for one app that is already based around sending pictures. Some of the features added do not enhance the experience of snap and instead causes more technical issues since so many features are running. Important features should be a priority and if it is causing technicals issues then FIX it or get RID of it. I am FED UP with the constant amount of issues this app has."
"You JUST updated the app after a whole day of the black screen issue, but the issue is still here, and I also can’t tap the icons on the bottom to transition from my snaps to my stories. Is this happening because of my device? Either way, please fix it because the update did not do anything. I’m also losing my streaks because of this issue, so when you eventually update this app again, please bring back the streaks that I supposedly “lost” just because of this ongoing issue. I also cannot reply to friends’ snaps with a snap of my own, because of the black screen issue. I can take the photo, but it only shows up after the photo is taken. Think of it like a Polaroid picture, where you have to wait for the image to show up after taking the photo. That is exactly what’s going on in general with the camera, but at least the photo immediately shows up after snapping your photo. Lastly, my friends’ Snapchat stories are starting to repeat themselves again, even when I have already viewed them. That needs to be taken care of, because that issue lasted AWHILE last time. I would also be open to share some newer ideas for the app; but for now these are the issues that I’m going to report on. Thank you."
"I can say confidently that me and all of my friends spend just about all of our time on Snapchat. It has brought many people I know together in ways I’ve never seen capable by another app. By far snapchat is my favorite and most used app. It is easy to use and has a smooth and appealing layout. I am not here to criticize, but simply to make a suggestion. I enjoy watching some of the shows on the “For you” tab. But I often find myself losing the show that I was just watching. I’ve noticed that thumbnails change after you go through the story, so that makes it hard to find what you clicked on in the first place. In particular I keep finding myself thinking “wow, I enjoyed that show, but I don’t remember what channel it was under. Though I only watched it 5 minutes ago.” Thus I would propose a sort of “history” feature for the “for you” page. (I would not like this for personal stories, only shows on the for you tab.) Possibly even just keep it in a more hidden spot because I do not need it as often as other things on Snapchat. But a feature like this would help me find and subscribe to the shows I enjoy. Thank you for reading."
"First of all i wanna talk about snapchats customer service issue
Its ridiculous i sat here for 30 -40 min on the website trying to figure out how to fill out a request to submit a complaint and i still cant find and ontop of that i cant call you guys to figure out whats the issue

Now to talk about the actual issue
I have been locked out of my account twice now(iv read the rules bu the way) and according to the rules i havnt done anything wrong? Once in a while ill add like 5-10 people bak or on quick add? Or post a whole bunch of videos on my storys but thats fine ? But this time i was permanently locked in the middle of writing a post. I went to see the issue of why i was permanently blocked but when i clicked to unlocked it said to click “here” so i did. When i clicked it everything crashed. I did this at least 10 times and everytime it crashed either telling me my browser was acting up or my internet wasnt secure. So i went on my phone to do it another 5 times and still didnt work. Yall need to fix this along with getting a real customer service area going on.. this is a waste of time going to the website when u cant get REAL help lemme also say iv been using Snapchat for probably 6-8 years and iv only had this problem this month. Yall also need to add a feature to change ur user so people dont have to start all over"
Hello and I’ve been on Snapchat for ever. But not once in my life have I seen the screen black and a little grey. I don’t know what to do and I’m not sure why Snapchat did that. Even all my friends were confused on it to because they have NEVER seen that before. Why out of all people it happened to me? Snapchat is my happy place and now it’s ruined you see I would delete the app and redown load it but I can’t because I don’t remember my password. I could make a new password if I could ACTUALLY GET IN SNAPCHAT. Please fix this thank you :) also I don’t understand these bug fixes because it’s never helped my Snapchat not once. After all these updates and bug fixes my Snapchat as been way slower. And with the screen I updated my phone for it I restarted my phone and I’m scared to delete the app with some reviews I read about us not downloading it again? Please fix Snapchat and let us change our names and give us dark mode. And stop locking people out of accounts! That’s happened to me three times and for what? I’ve been on Snapchat for years no one deserves that stuff because then you have to start all over again and it’s annoying it really is. Take away the new update to there is no use for it and just fix Snapchat Jesus. I’ve waited all day and today is a new day fix it. Snapchat was working perfectly fine until this happened
"I was recently banned from Snapchat for no reason at all. I have no clue what terms of service I violated because it will not tell me as to why I was banned. I use it to communicate with all my friends and it’s the only service that actually works in the school as far as reaching out to friends goes. I don’t even care if I can get my snap account back I just want to be able to use the app. I’ve had no previous bans before this. Just straight up deleted my account and terminated me from ever making another one. All the memories I had stored up in that account just for them to be wiped away for no reason. Thanks for ruining my week. I have a suspicion that i was spam reported by a person who was constantly making new accounts to reach out to me. If so, why would I be able to be reported by an account that was only made mere seconds after it was created? Please help me resolve this issue because the moment I try to contact you I am met with a bot. I understand that it would be hard to manage an influx of messages of people like me that were banned. But it is not justifiable that I was banned after just one mere violation that I do not even know I did. Not because I didn’t read the rules, but because it was not discussed what I did to deserve a first time violation which resulted in a permanent ban from making snap accounts ever."
"OK I love Snapchat so much are use it every single day I use it for everything to text my friends call my friends post on my story let people know what I’m doing and I love it so much but, if it were just faster!!!Lately it has been lagging and axing me out of the tab and doing really crazy stuff lately at this point it’s getting very annoying and I wish you would just stop the most recent iOS update on Snapchat was just three days ago this is becoming absolutely absurd if they’re having updates within three days and it still continuing to be bad and having really bad bugs and saying that they’re fixing them is not correct, they actually need to fix the bugs and fix the lagging and fix all the terrible loading and axing out of the tabs and all the really crappy things and Snapchat will be perfect this is just my opinion but many other people are experiencing this to it has just been recently so it’s good that hasn’t been really really bad but lately it has been very bad many people running or changing the same thing so I know it’s not just me on my phone so let me know if you’re exchanging the same thing to!"
"Hello! I just wanted to say that I personally love Snapchat. I use it more often than iMessage. Though I have to say that the fact that there isn’t a recovery option for memories really bothers me, and I’m sure I’m not the only person who has run into a problem like this on Snapchat. I had a memory that I held dearly to me. I was editing my memory small segments at a time. When I was editing, there was a small segment of that memory that I didn’t want to keep, so I had tapped delete believing it would delete that portion only, not knowing that it was going to delete the entire snap itself. Having made it two years ago, I hadn’t realized till now that I didn’t save it to my camera roll at the time being. I was wondering if there’s any way possible to incorporate a recovery option into snap, or maybe even make it possible for us to recover our memories without saving them to our camera roll? Though if there is a way to recover memories without having saved them to my camera roll, I would really appreciate the tips and feedback. I lost all hope for saving the memory after seeing that it is stated on the Snapchat support page that there is no way of recovering unless backed up on the camera roll."
Absolutely horrible I’ve had my snap account since what ? 2018 I’m pretty sure well anyways this new update caused a glitch and in the middle of the glitch snap just sent me an email saying my snap account had been deleted and is not recoverable so not only are all of the pictures I had on only snap chat are gone Ex: all of my dead grandparents and those pictures nobody else had and some life long friends that I only had one snap chat are gone as well and will never get them back so after over five hours of trying to get back into my snap trying to contact someone in snap chat sending emails and trying to find a help line with a human involved news flash that doesn’t exist when it comes to them so I gave up and lost all hope on my old account so I made a new one verified my phone number and email on it and started to get followers back for the next 12 hours finally got some of the people back some of my main friends and all of a sudden my account had been locked !! Without me doing anything wrong  literally within the same day of me getting the new Snapchat it got locked so then I tried to find where I can get it unlocked and turns out you can’t!! So now I don’t know what to do because this has gone on for two days now and I’m just defeated and have no clue where turn and nobody is helping me
"I have 2 Snapchat accounts. My personal one and one I share with someone else. So I go back and forth between them often because they’re used for different things and have different friends etc. after the newest updates about a week or 2 ago, my personal and the other accounts look like they merged. But they haven’t. It’s confusing. Now on my personal account it shows I have friends from the other accounts list but I know for a fact my personal doesn’t have those people as friends. But also when I look at their profiles it has the blue check indicated they’re added to me but on their snapscore it just says loading instead of their number score. And vise versa on the other account. So while they’re on my friends lise they aren’t actually friends with me which is confusing. Same with blocked list. People I have blocked on my account but not on the other ARE blocked on the 2nd one too and still vise versa. This is extremely frustrating because I have the accounts separate for a reason so for them to be together is irritating. The solution is deleting Snapchat and redownloading and it’s fixed BUT the moment I sign out of one and sign in to the other again, they’re merged again. I don’t want to have to keep deleting Snapchat every time I log out of one and go into the other"
"I was really impressed with Snapchat back in the day, in that it enabled photo messaging and added filters to help with those of us who may have a bad skin day, keep our blemishes hidden by a smoother so when we send our friends a snap it doesn’t show our embarrassing acne spot to our possible crush, etc. The new updates to Snapchat are disastrous. First; I can not clear an entire conversation column and have to go one by one through the messages to clear them. Also you can’t look up your friends; how is anyone supposed to organize their friends list if we can’t even see who’s our friend without searching them? If you have 20 or so friends you are basically spending 2 minutes of your time trying to clear your snap window. Second; the stories; filled with biased propaganda and absolute garbage. I enjoy subscribing to some of the channels but the fact that most of these channels feature some of the most controversial topics and are completely one sided is unfortunate. I would like to see more middle liner content, and keep politics out of the playground unless your going to equalize and allow those who may not swing to the left side of the scale, be able to enjoy the features as well. Please read and consider Snapchat"
"i’ve had this app for the LONGEST time! but recently i have been having a HUGE problem. about 4-5 days ago my snapchat would not let me save any pictures because “i didn’t have enough storage”. i checked my storage and i definitely had enough. every time i tried to watch a story it would glitch to another one and wouldn’t even let me watch that one. everything took forever to send and my notifications for me receiving something came in later than they were supposed to ! so i tried to update it , that didn’t work. then i tried to log out so i could log back in to see if that would fix it. now it won’t even let me back in. it shows me in the camera but then it throws me out. some people i know have been dealing with this same problem as well. i’ve had someone else logging into my snap so they could send my streaks. i log into it every now and then off of someone else’s phone so that i can see what’s going on and watch people’s stories. i can’t delete apps on my phone because of a password my dad set and then forgot so there’s no way i can uninstall and then reinstall the app. snapchat i love you but fix yourself!!! please do it soon , all of my pictures and memories are on there , and that’s the only way i really talk to my friends."
"Hey Snapchat Team! I hope all of you guys are working safe during these times of the global pandemic going on, but I have an inquiry. I see that recently you guys released a new update about 2 days ago and today this morning Snapchat updated to the newest version. For some odd reason my photos aren’t going through at all and no stories are loading up. I tried closing the app out wait a few minutes and reopen it and resend my snap, but it still wouldn’t go through. I decided to just log out and log back in to see if that’ll help, but to my surprise it didn’t let me log back in and told me I had a connection problem. My WiFi is working perfectly for my other applications and social media platforms at this time, but some reason Snapchat isn’t liking my WiFi so I switch over to my Data network and still I’m getting the connection timed out message, telling me that I have a connection problem. Please help as soon as you guys can to resolve this issue! I thank you guys in advance and don’t work to hard during these times! God bless. -Mark L. Garcia"
"I love Snapchat so much I have everything on there and go on the app 24/7. But this has happened to me twice now. I logged out of my account to go to my other one when I couldn’t get into my other one. I just decided to go back into my main account cause my other one wasn’t working and then it said “try logging in another way” or something like that so I did I tried about a million times and still couldn’t get in I deleted the app more then 10 times I turned off my phone 4 times I searched it up I reset my password and I still can’t get into any account on my phone this is the second time this has happen I keep panicking cause I get so much text messages from people on there and I just need to get back into my account snapchat needs to fix this asap. 

Also another thing is it said “can’t find the matching credentials” but I have the passwords saved and it says that to every account I try to log into now my cell signal is at 1/2 blocks and I got it to 3 and still couldn’t get in so it’s just Snapchat the only way I can talk to people now it by iMessage but still I need to get back in, Snapchat FIX this."
"Why do we get our accounts locked ? idk but i find that very stupid. How come there’s guys and girls out there sending naked pictures to children and they don’t get locked out ? For example. my account was temporarily locked and it was because i was adding too many people without my email setup and all i had to do was delete the app and reinstall it and unlock my account. Well after i set everything up i was in a group chat and had added some of the people for friends. When i got home i tried to login and it said my account was locked, keep in mind i didn’t do anything. My email and phone number was setup and everything. So when i went to the website to unlock it, it said my account was permanently locked. What did i do ? I don’t have Yolo or Lmk etc. I’ve been trying to get back in and it’s not working. I’ve had this account for 4 years and i have memories, streaks, friends, stories.. my whole life. Knowing i can’t get back in really makes me mad. What also makes me mad is that when i email Team Snapchat, they don’t help at all. This was jus my concern and advice and frustration. Thank you for reading this :)"
"If I could give less than 1 I would 😂 I used to LOVE being able to use Snapchat for my promotions, to take funny videos of my kids etc, they loved it! But I am very very disappointed with Snapchat at the moment!! A few weeks ago my account was terminated out of the blue at 11 one night. (Shortly after having exchanged words with a neighbor who I suspect reported me even though what was said was said elsewhere and what was said by me was not rude in no way, shape, or form.)
 I’ve sent an email but got an instant response saying my account was terminated and once an account is terminated they can’t help. There is no phone number, no email whatsoever to get in touch with their support center. I had went without Snapchat for years up until a few months ago when I decided to make a new one to promote my business and to see videos and pictures of my 10 month old when he’s visiting family members. I am very very furious I have not been able to get this resolved. I’ve reached out to their Facebook support page and got nowhere there as well. 
If I make a new account it automatically locks..I’m very disappointed with the customer service Snapchat offers. 
If someone sees this and will help me fix whatever issues are going on with my account, yeah I would highly appreciate that!!!!"
"Let’s start with it logging me out. Sometimes I will go away for maybe less than 30 minutes and come back and I’m logged out, or it might even say your account has been locked, I’ve had to unlock my account maybe 6 times already, and I had only made it in July, (well a new account since my other one was permanently locked). The chatting is another thing, sometimes it will take up to 5 minutes for my snaps or chats to send, also when I save them it doesn’t say I did it just keeps on saying save to chat. I wish that they would load immediately and the chats would automatically save. I also would like if we could pin more than 3 people!. Snapchat Score, I don’t like how I send snaps and my score doesn’t go up right away, I have to exit the app and open it again for my snap score to be accurate, it’s aggravating. Everything else I am in love with, the dark screen, the astrological profiles, the bitmojis, the stories, the settings, everything else doesn’t bother me it’s just those things that do bother me and it bothers others too, it would be nice of you Snapchat to fix some of these things, not just to make the app better but to make the people happier who use it."
"I’m bored right now but I really think this app is a problem for everyone in my opinion, so I’m going to talk about it. Snapchat is nothing special people, it’s just an app causes addictions to people being on their phones more. Not saying the app is bad but it’s also not the best. Everyday I’m in class and I see about almost everyone on there phone because of it, for what? All people think about nowadays are followers, looking cool for their crush who they don’t even talk to, and getting on there phone. It blows my mind how people can’t be on their phones for at least 5 minutes. Not saying this generation is terrible but this generation, has been the worst. People are so selfish rude etc and technology has glued everyone on it. I had Snapchat because I thought it was for the “cool” people, instead I got on it every single day and got my family glued to the app. We all got rid of it because of it we were in our phones all the time, that is not good. Technology is controlling our lives, if you understand everything I’m talking about then you know how crazy and sad that is. I’m sorry to all the girls out there who think they’re popular and pretty because of it but don’t try and look good for your crush or anything like that and don’t be fake, just be who you are. That’s kinda rare in this world right now."
Don’t mind that Snapchat is an okay app but what’s going on!?!?!?! It’s shutting down the app isn’t installing and honestly the app is going all funky and weird??? What’s wrong It’s not only me because it’s been happening to my friends too and everyone of my friends app just shut down and when we uninstalled and tried to reinstall it won’t work honestly this is bad because this is how I talk to my friends everyday and I have a lot of people added in there that I don’t have there numbers nor any other social app. Snapchats one of the my number one source but recently it’s been really bad. I don’t want to assume it’s everyone app that shut down but me and my friends app shut down completely and we’re trying to re install but it won’t and when I tried to open it before I deleted the app it didn’t let me in is kept crashing. Is this happening to anyone else or just me and my friends am honestly worried it might have gotten hacked but that would be impossible since I have never given my account to anybody. I hope this is just a glitch or Snapchat crashing. But i really am hoping Snapchat is just updating. Can someone help if this is just a me problem and has happened to you before???
"I’ve had Snapchat for a long time now, and I love the app. It is a way that I can stay in touch with my friends and get to know new ones. Of course ever app has its bad days and glitches, like the other day, but something that annoys me greatly and has never been fixed is the time that the notifications that someone you subscribed to comes in. I am subscribed to a couple influencers and I have notifications on for two or three of them. I will sometimes be on the app and see that they posted and view their story, and of course, I would view their story so there would really be no need for a notification. Even though this occurs sometimes, I will get a notification five to ten minutes later about the same person, and it would be in regard to the post that I already viewed. Something else that happens with the notifications is that I do not receive them until about fifteen minutes after the post has been up. The reason I have notifications on is to see it in the first couple minutes, not in the first hour. If there is something that can be done to fix this, it would be greatly appreciated."
I mean I like snap and all and I use it a lot it’s just been messing up my phone a bit. So you see whenever I open Snapchat it’s gets kinda glitchy and I don’t like that when I open it and exit and then re open it and go into my camera roll on snap it won’t let me select more pictures and videos until i exit and clear it from my data and have to re open the app and it’s just a pain so yeah and the new update I mean it’s okay kinda annoying I liked the original snap and I mean it’s not that bad there’s some things better like it’s easier to hack to do screenshots with out the other person knowing oh that’s another thing I don’t like that it lets the other person know you took a screenshot of there snap or chat it’s just annoying because than they ask why and you have to make up some excuse but another thing is whenever I try to send a video to someone from like Tik tok to snap if it’s over 11 seconds it’s won’t let me and then I have to save the vid to my camera roll and do that whole exiting entering thing I was saying earlier. But over all i use snap a lot and I like it there’s just a few things that could be done differently. Thank you snap chat and have a good day everyone!! ☺️
i use snapchat to chat with my friends and record memories but ever since yesterday i’ve been having a problem when i enter the app all i see is a black screen and the circle to record and take pictures but that’s it after a bit if it doesn’t immediately kick me out i just see the same screen frozen now because of it i’m probably going to lose my streaks. other than that i still get notifications. I think the problem it’s not letting me in is because my front camera isnt working but my front camera hasn’t been working for a while and snapchat still let me in and use it but i can only take pictures on the back camera. i tried deleting the app and re downloading it and when it ask me permissions for stuff i accept it but one i accept camera usage it kicks me out. then i decided to try again but this time i didn’t accept camera usage it tell me that snapchat is a camera app and doesn’t let me proceed. and then once i let camera usage it kicks me out or just crashes the app. hope snapchat can fix this 👻
"I have used Snapchat daily for almost 8 years. I had my original account since the app first launched and my account was terminated without any sort of warning or reasoning. I had memories of dead friends, dead relatives, and dead pets etc. I had content stored on my account that was priceless to me. I also had contacts with people I have no other contact with outside of Snapchat and everything was taken away with a matter of minutes.  Recently a lot of my friends have been disappearing on snap for “violating” the very foggy and unclear terms of service and this is where my account was flagged for termination too. I am a medical marijuana patient and have been for the Majority of the time I was a snap chat account holder. I had posted a picture of my medicine with the caption, “‼️medicinal use only, Not For Sale‼️”  and within minutes of being posted for my FRIENDS to see I was deleted from existence from snapchat along with all of my memories, contacts, conversations etc. it’s sickening. I have tried to reach out to support to rectify the wrongful termination of my account, how SNAPCHAT HAS BEEN THE WORST COMPANY TO DEAL WITH IN REGARDS TO CUSTOMER SUPPORT. I have loved this app for nearly a decade, however, they have lost a tenured consumer of their app and I will continue to let all of my friends know, it’s time to boycott Snapchat."
"I’ve had Snapchat for several years now, and it’s always been one of (if not my favorite) social media platform. It’s easy and fun to use, and it’s a great way to keep in contact with friends. All the filters make for some great selfie-taking, and you really get a personalized experience, which I love. The only thing I wish was different is that there is no dark mode. I have an iPhone, and Apple has been super receptive to feedback when it came to allowing a dark mode for phones. It’s really an awesome feature, since even on the lowest brightness you could burn out your corneas with the pure white screens of the App Store, iMessage, iTunes, and more. Thankfully, those are all in dark mode now, which is great in the middle of the night as well as in broad daylight. I really wish Snapchat would look into making a dark mode for their users as well, since lots of people (myself included) really prefer dark mode. There’s something about the look of it that I love, and an added bonus is that I don’t go blind at nighttime. I wish I could say the same for snap. Snapchat, please consider a dark mode for your users. I don’t think I’m the only person that would like to have it."
"First of all I’d like to say that I have never once reviewed any other app on the App Store. However, I feel the need to rate SnapChat 1 star because of the number of times my account has gotten locked since I downloaded the app about a month ago. I use a Jailbroken iPhone 11 because I like the freedom of my device and being able to do whatever I want with it without the manufacturer (Apple) preventing me. Jailbreaking is NOT illegal and does NOT mean I’m doing anything that an average user wouldn’t do with SnapChat. I have no tweaks that modify SnapChat in any way. I’ve done the things that SnapChat  recommends to avoid getting my account locked while jailbroken. My account still gets locked at least every week. The fact that SnapChat is so against jailbreaking concerns me as to why they don’t support people having freedom of their device. It makes me think they do shady things. Banning people for wanting their device to be the way they like it is absurd. It’s one thing to ban someone for modifying SnapChat to do things that it wasn’t intended to do but to ban someone for wanting to change the icons on their home screen, change the system font, set a GIF as a wallpaper, or other minor changes is stupid and that’s why I regret downloading this app."
"I have been using Snapchat for two years now and I never had this problem of not getting notifications from Snapchat ever for some oddly reason there was a bug that I have heard and I had it yesterday. My bug was ever when I close the app it told other people that I was just leaving them on red and ignoring them when in reality I didn’t have Snapchat open. I don’t know if the update didn’t work because there was an update and I just updated it this morning or somethings wrong with my device but you guys need to fix it because it just doesn’t make any sense. And to describe the bug more that happened yesterday, I read peoples messages but I kept showing up as a new chat and some people when you don’t keep on texting me because I was having conversations with other people but it kept saying new chat when I haven’t talk to this person or an hour ago but that parts fixed now there’s an issue where I don’t get notifications that somebody text me on Snapchat and I have to open the app for it to see if someone text me other than seeing the notification pop-up on my screen"
"Yesterday I was letting my friend use my snapchat as I usually let him do to contact people and friends since he doesn’t own a phone right now. However, while he was using it I believe he posted something on my story or a private story that was against snapchat’s “Terms of Service”. Because of this my account was permanently deleted and I was IP banned on my phone. This is heartbreaking because I have used snapchat loyally for over 5 years and had 5 years of memories in there that would be devastating to lose. I’ve been diagnosed with a dissociative disorder that causes amnesia which makes it difficult for me to fully remember some of the best times of my life. For me losing my memories in snapchat is like losing those memories for good. I didn’t even get a warning… no three strikes… no nothing… after 5 years one post and my snapchat is gone and I can’t even create a new account. This seems extremely irrational and unfair, I was really hoping that there was some way I could get my account back or at the very least my memories, however, every time i try to contact customer support they send a robot to help me that gives the same response no matter what I say. This isn’t only unprofessional but it’s truly truly upsetting. I would rate the app zero starts if i could"
"I've had Snapchat for over 2 years now. Snapchat is a fun, creative way to express yourself and talk to friends or meet new people. Most people, including myself, will add people off of quick add. Sometimes these people will express and share unwanted and unnecessary opinions or show body parts, and Snapchat makes it easy to disconnect from these people by simply un-adding them. I haven't really had any problems with snap, except for one or two things that need to be fixed. Number one is the fact that when I send or receive streaks, that they will send or show twice, which is very annoying. Second, it glitches and tells me that I have to go back and re-add everyone that I have on snap because I don't have them added already. And last but not least, is that fact that sometimes it freezes when you try a filter on, or write something on a picture. These are small problems, but I'm not the only one experiencing these problems. Over all, Snapchat is a fun app with a good image. I wouldn't recommend letting anyone who isn't at least 12 have Snapchat. Thank you for your time. 🙌🏽♥️"
"So I was on my snapchat and all of a sudden it just stopped working. I completely shut my phone off and I re-opened the app back up to see it still wasn’t working. So I thought the best way was to delete the app the download it again. So I did that, but then it wasn’t letting me log into my account? It kept saying “check your internet” and everything was just slow. When I finally got back into my account after like 5 minutes.. it showed I didn’t have any friends or anything, no pictures, no nothing, and then it finally loaded again after like 5 minutes. I can’t post stuff in my story without seeing the “failed to post” thing. My snaps were disappearing too, and they were my friends snaps not showing up. I finally got the app to work but not as well because it still is doing the same thing other than me being able to see my friends snaps. I hope you fix it soon because I’m really not enjoying how it is right now because it’s not working for anyone and my internet is perfectly fine. So that’s why I’m asking you again to just fix the problem. Please and thank you!"
"don’t get me wrong, i love snapchat. it’s my main form of communication, socializing, and seeing the lives of my friends. but, it does have its moments of issues. my main one is the fact that my chats and snaps open on their own. it’s extremely frustrating because my friends will text me on another app for communicating or even double text on snapchat asking me or telling me i’ve left them on open, which i NEVER did. i didn’t even get to see the texts and/or snaps they’ve sent. another big issue for me is the fact that my discovery and story viewing section of the app glitches continuously through out the day. it makes my subscribed stories disappear for a solid 5 minutes even after closing and reopening the apps, leaves up stories i’ve already watched, and the discovery channel (due to the horrible discovery snap algorithm) is a bunch of half naked pics of influencers or stupid stories i’ve shown no interest to saying it’s “for me”. i also know these have been ongoing issues for many of my friends, and many verified accounts i’ve become acquainted to. i have used snapchat for years, and as much as i don’t wanna stop using it, these issues are horrendously obnoxious."
"I have been using snapchat since 2013. In the past six years I have seen such an development in quality, options, and overall popularity. This app is like a lion and every phone the app touches, is it’s kingdom. I enjoy Snapchat. I enjoy the streaks. I really enjoy the meme accounts I’m subscribed to! But there’s one thing that I just can’t get behind. The Discover Page. I’ll be straight up honest with you, it is the one thing that makes takes that fifth star away. Ya’ll just came out with a new update. I was excited to hear that you could change the settings with the Discover Page. I went to these setting (to turn off the page) to DISCOVER (haha ha, dad joke) that there’s still no way at ALL that I can turn it off. Look, and I’ll put it bluntly, I love your app except for that one thing. I think you should be able to have the option to turn it off. I simply just don’t care about it and would rather not see it. Now I might just be the only one on this planet that doesn’t like it, or there are tons of other people that don’t enjoy it either. Anyways, I’m sorry for the rant, I just really wanna see that change is all. Have a good one!"
"I’ve used snap for a few years and have never had as bad issues before. It constantly lags when I first open it, and chats wont show up constantly, and it often says I left someone on opened but I had sent a message back to them, it’s getting really annoying having to apologize to my friends for the stupidest stuff, like maybe fix your bugs and issues before trying to copy tiktok. I personally do not use tiktok because of how toxic the community is, and now I keep seeing everything copy that god for saken app, Instagram has done the same thing. Literally everything on the snap reels or whatever is just stuff shared from tiktok. And don’t get me started in the ads on the stories, I get when you’re looking through friends stories, you can just skip those, but the stories from anything else is HORRIBLE. Every 5 seconds there’s a 5 second ad! The stories aren’t even worth looking at anymore because of how many ads are in them! Snapchat has honestly just become terrible, I only use it anymore because I talk to so many people on it, and I don’t wanna lose my streaks. If you are thinking about getting this app, don’t. It’s not worth it."
"I have been using Snapchat since about 2014. I haven’t had an issue until a day ago when my account was “temporarily locked”. When I received the email, I carefully read the reasons why my account could be locked. I do not, nor have I ever had a third party app installed on my phone. I also have not violated any community guidelines. My email and phone number have been verified for a while now. There was absolutely no information on how long this lock was supposed to last in the email. I also attempted to unlock my account through the link provided in the email, however it said it was unable to process my request. So how am I supposed to unlock my account? I have tried various forms of communication to try and get this issue resolved, with absolutely no help except repeated information on why my account could be locked (even though I stated none of the reasons are true) and sending the unlock link, which again, still doesn’t work. The lack of service and support provided by Snapchat is so very frustrating. And it’s not just me. Twitter and these reviews are flooded with people disappointed in their experience with your so called “support”. Please do better. It’s embarrassing for your company that so many people have reached out and yet nothing has changed."
"I am sorry but please go back to the previous version. I have had Snapchat forever and this is the worst possible update. I do not need 5 screens to show everything! I seriously am so disappointed the black tool bar at the bottom is not useful at all. It does not need to be there and it was so much better to just swipe 3 screens. I do not need a screen to find my friends on snap maps it was so much easier to use the camera screen and swipe up. I’m sorry the update is just not aesthetically pleasing anymore. The black room bar at the bottom is pointless. The 5 different screens is just too much!!!! It was so much better when it was 3!!!!! Also the wag that it’s like zoomed in on the chat bar is so weird.  Also like where do I search for more filters! It’s not at the end of the filters line anymore! Also the discover bar is pointless. Like why is there even a screen like that it was way better when u valued just press a button and go there from the stories tab. It honestly wasn’t even an update it just made it way worse. Why add more stuff when the previous version was perfect! PLEASE go back to the previous version!!!!! It was so much better with the 3 screens, and get rid of the black tool bar it’s so stupid!!!! I’m disappointed and want the old one back :(🤢👎🏻"
"personally i love the app. i’ve been using since 2015 and they’re have been some changes both good and bad. i think we all remember the end of 2019 when there were rumors of the app shutting down. well that was the start of the end for mine and most of my friends/families snapchats. the update that changes the bottom of the layout within the app i still haven’t been able to download while my friends had it last year? anyways that’s not really a big deal because they all said it crashes their snap almost every day and messes with their stories. and recently, even up to  today, snapchat has been sending snaps to the wrong people or sometimes sending one without even being on the app. it causes a little panic attack because you have to think “WHAT DID I JUST SEND THEM?!” and i fully understand that there are plenty of new accounts being made everyday slowing down the app but there are other apps with WAY more people that are carrying fine. i would just like to the snapchat excel like it once did before any of the new layout change updates or changes to colors. However one of the apps best changes was bitmoji. they really changed the way people view the app and make it a lot easier!"
"I am now distraught AGAIN....Because I loved snapchats camera and effects, I recreated a new account after my old account being hacked by someone and thankfully getting it back (without any help from snapchat). Now, I my account got permanently locked 10secs after posting a picture supporting a friends’ business that seemed to go against SNAPCHAT guidelines that I didn't know of. It wasn't even on my main story. It was a private post for close my friends. I don't even have the option to make a new account just to use for the camera because it recognizes my phone number and email as soon as I tried to make a new account. I just wanted to sync and save my years of memories with friends. I wish Snapchat would've gave me a warning of the restriction while the post was loading, or just banned me for a while. I couldn't even get my data of memories to download. I'm just so upset and I had a break down when this happened AGAIN. 

I see from the comments I'm not the only one. I just had to block a sugarma from snapping me, but my accounts gets locked. Nobody even reported my post because I got locked out 10secs after I posted it. Snapchat needs to give us access to our accounts again even if we can't post to the public anymore. I just want my videos and pictures back."
"I love Snapchat and I use it every single day then you’re probably like “ well why did you put 3 stars” here’s why... Few times here recently I had to logout to let someone else login and when I logged back in most of my recents had disappeared. They’re still my friends but their name doesn’t show up. I have to go and search for them to message. A few people even just added me and sent me snaps I didn’t get the chance to open them and their name and snap disappeared it’s like they had never even snapped me. Again I love snap it’s honestly the only app I use but this is really becoming a pain. I have never had a problem with logging out and logging in until here recently. Also, my snap score isn’t going up it goes up on mine but if I have someone look at my snap score it’s like 60,000 lower than what mine says. I know a lot of people have been having problems with the snap score the past few weeks. I’m also not getting any Snapchat notifications and I only know when someone snaps me if I go on Snapchat. It doesn’t show any new one’s and after a few minutes they just appear. So if you guys could fix these issues I will gladly give you 5 stars."
"I’ve been using Snapchat for 3 years now and I’ve finally gotten use to it being one of my primary apps. As we all know, dark mode has been around barely that long, but I was wondering if it could be added on Snapchat? I know so many apps that have dark mode and they aren’t even Apple apps. Since it’s also a messaging app I feel as if that would make it much more convenient to use at night. 
Another thing that I love about Snapchat is that it has such a wide variety of filters to choose from made by people like me. The problem is, there’s SOO many filters I love so much, and want to use all the time, but the only way to use it is to scroll for it through the search or memorize the name to search it up yourself. I wish there was a favorite button, so wen you find a filter you like you can actually save it for over weeks, months, etc. Obviously the amount of favorites will show on the filter too, so you can tell what filters are trending. 

That’s about it. Thanks for reading! I hope these get added."
"I was banned without warning and lost 6 years of memories. I have a medical problem with severe memory loss as a side effect. This has emotionally devastated me as I had thousands of pictures and videos that are now permanently gone. They gave no reason other than “I violated terms of service” which I did infact not. I lost all contact to my friends as I moved hours away from my hometown and this was the only way for me to have human interaction with my past. I just wish I could get a response as to what I have done so wrong that they perm deleted my account and made it so I can’t make a new one. I can’t afford to buy a brand new phone and get a new number to make a new one which would only solve one of my major 5 problems. I know the policy is that they will not unban a deleted account but I genuinely don’t think I did a single thing wrong. I know this is a “millennial problem” but Snapchat was a huge part of my life. If it was a problem with some of the memories deemed “inappropriate” to Snapchat’s guidelines, I will gladly remove said pictures and videos but again I don’t think I had anything that violated those terms. This has to have been a mistake. Please I am begging you to allow me to remember my past and have some contact from my friends and family."
"I have been utilizing this app for many years and have always been impressed with the variety of features it has added over time. I admire how the app keeps one connected to people who are far away, and those close by as well. I have never had a single complaint about the app that is, until today. My boyfriend and I have been dating for 6 months and as a result we have acquired the pink hearts over that period of time. Today, however, I logged into my Snapchat to see that it was gone and instead replaced by a yellow heart saying that we have now just become “besties.” I would like to argue that this is false because we Snapchat every day and only really Snapchat each other. I believe that this must have been a glitch and would like it to be fixed. If our pink hearts were to be brought back, I would reconsider my initial review and come back to edit it by adding that Snapchat was very responsive and attentive to my request. Thank you, and I am hoping to see this fixed soon. Annnnnd as promised, I am back to add to my review. Thank you Snapchat for giving us our pink hearts back- and so quickly too!"
"I love the app but my account was locked on Thursday around 5:30 and I still haven’t been able to get back in please help me I thought I would be able to unlock it within 24 hours but it hasn’t worked I tried to use the link that was sent to me to restore my account but it didn’t work and my account is legitimate I don’t think I have done anything to break regulations other than posting a meme that could’ve been slightly offensive but it wasn’t even mine and if that were the case it disappears from your story within 24 hours so I don’t see the issue and your website is a joke because you don’t actually get to talk to anyone from customer support it’s just a robotic system where are you say what the problem is and it takes you to an article  and it doesn’t even give you an email to contact

Edit: it was locked on Thursday at 5:30 PM and it is now 10:36 PM on Saturday and I uninstalled the app and reinstalled and hit the unlock button and got my account back but Snapchat help should be more readily available I want to talk to a real person I don’t want to deal with searching through an article database or a robot"
"okay, so for about a year i've had my snapchat account. no problems at all. i had another one before that but it was a really immature user so i decided to get a new one as i started taking snapchat more seriously. then i have this account for a year. i just started getting memories from a year ago and i finally got comfortable with my snapchat. the other day i went out and i was using snap. i closed the app and went for lunch. while waiting for my food i go into snap and my account is LOGGED OUT. i got super confused and tried logging in. my password wouldn't work and i was so mad. my friends started texting me asking if i unadded them or blocked them. i was so confused and they told me my account was deactivated. i was so mad and i thought i got hacked. so i got home and emailed them. i got no email back but 5 minutes later i get an email saying my account is permanently deleted for violating terms of service. LIKE WHAT!? so i have my new account and i'm scared to death that if i ever log out i will get locked out. also, my BEST friend got permanently locked out the exact same time! so we're super confused and he's currently on his 5th account IN TWO DAYS because they keep getting locked and terminated for no reason! fix this right now because i'm sick of this."
"I AM HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM AS SHRILLEX - THE REVIEW BEFORE MINE THAT WAS POSTED MONDAY. Yesterday at approximately 3:00 pm i was logged out of my snapchat account and would not let me log back in, so i tried to log in on multiple devices and would not let me. so i logged into my backup account i have had for a while now and it LOCKED that account seconds after letting me login. so i thought to myself this is ridiculous i shouldn't be dealing with this and made a new snapchat on my phone which it let me do and let me login and add friends and talk to them for maybe FIVE MINUTES before LOCKING MY NEW ACCOUNT as well. i figured it was just a one day lock or something so i waited 24 hours before trying to login to snapchat and still nothing for any of the accounts. so i went to snapchats help website and turns out they PERMANENTLY LOCKED MY NEW ACCOUNT I JUST MADE AND MY BACKUP ACCOUNT. and it tells me it cant even find my main account that i have had for YEARS. i have over 2000 photos and videos AT LEAST that are not saved on my phone. so i am upset about that, but i am even more upset at the fact that snapchat won't even let me use their app on my iphone 11, like it won't let me login on snapchat nor will it allow me to make a new snapchat. this is ridiculous and i am VERY UPSET. PLEASE FIX THIS."
"I have been patient for i’d say the past 6 months to a year with the new pointless updates and the way snapchat looks. Im sick of it constantly updating because every time it updates snapchat gets worse and worse every time. there has been little bugs for the past year on and off but since the 3D bitmoji came, it seems to have brought viruses. now that can’t actually be the case so what is going on? i’ve lost patience and i’m ready to delete the app. 
it logs me out of my snapchat, when i have it on dark mode, it kicks me out of snapchat when i click on the icon, then when i come back in it’s light mode and all my snaps are unpinned. when i take pictures and send them, they say there sending them just delete. 
my memories are starting to delete, and nothing is sending to anyone and it seems like I have some sort of virus on my phone. I shouldnt!!!! this only happens on snapchat why is that?
I’m sick of snapchat, and I’m honestly ready to delete it. Nothing works, it kicks me out, changes from light to dark mode when i try to access the app, deletes all of my notifications, deletes my memories, when i’m listening to music, it kicks me out of snap and also turns off my music! I can go on and on! and i shouldn’t be able too!!!
i miss the old snapchat."
"So I used to always use Snapchat until a friend asked me if I could continue their streaks because they weren’t going to be able to use their phone for a while so I logged into their account the next morning and it tells me “Hey you banned” and I’m like “huh, why?”. I asked my friend and she said that I she was supposed to log out first and I’m like ok I’ll probably get my account back later… it’s been months. Every time I log in it tells me that I’m block or it lets me in for a while but if I tab out it simply logs me off and tells me I’m blocked. I don’t remember doing anything illegal or wrong in the app other than bully my friend into going to her online class because she is too lazy to do it herself and she needs someone to tell her to. If Snapchat themselves sees this, can y’all help me out here? It’s been a while but I still miss it or at least a good reason for why I was banned. I tried the Snapchat website but I don’t see any “contact us directly”. Again, if y’all see this can you guys help me or give me a reason why? Please?"
"I’ve been using SnapChat for several years. I’ve enjoyed it a lot, never encountering an issue. Then suddenly, things began to change over the past few weeks.
One night, I noticed that all of my Streaks had the time capsule next to them, indicating that they were about to end. So, I sent out Streaks to everyone, thus causing the time capsule to disappear and an extra day to be added to each Streak. When I woke up the next morning, approximately 9 hours later, all of my Streaks remained in tact except for one; my longest streak, spanning over 800 days plus. 
This is despite the fact that I sent out Streaks to everyone the night before, and all of the time capsules disappeared. Yet, just 1 Streak ended. The next day, both my friend (who I had the terminated streak with) and I filed reports through the app about the malfunction, but we’re left without a response. 
Since that day, I’ve encountered other issues such as the app crashing, Streaks failing to send despite having WiFi, and messages failing to send. I’m very disappointed in the malfunctioning of what was seemingly a reliable app for years, and the lack of customer service dealt to acknowledge my filed report. It would be upsetting if this went unnoticed, and a reliable user of an app was left dissatisfied."
"Ok so I have been using Snapchat for a while now. It’s a great app I use it to keep in touch with my friends and post random stuff. But lately, snapchats been bugging out. So here’s my problem:
I viewed my friends story nothing unusual, then it slid to the next persons story and so on and so fourth. Then a couple hours later I go back to Snapchat and it says I haven’t viewed their story yet. I was a little confused but viewed there story again anyway. I could see that they posted something new because I saw it on the little circle thing next to their name😂. But when I viewed the story I saw the exact same story I already viewed. This happened with four different people. I thought it was my phone even though it’s brand new. So I deleted Snapchat, logged back in, and the same thing happened. I did that numerous times before I just gave up and decided to write a review. (also another issue was I viewed one persons story then the next then the next but after that one as I was tapping for the next persons story it kept showing me that same persons story when there were still more to view?)
I really hope you take the time to read my review and fix this little issue.😊"
I love the app ofc it’s a great way for communication and the filters make it so awesome to take pictures and can really boost confidence. Literally I just have like a couple things that I don’t love about it. For the app appearance whenever you change the color of the app I wish that it stayed even when you log out or delete the app. I tend to switch from account to account to send my friends streaks and changing my main accounts app appearance every time I log on can get repetitive and annoying. Along with this but for some reason I’ve been getting random people that didn’t even show up in like the adds to accept their friend request text me and it’s like weird things mainly doing with like sexual content and relationships.  I don’t know if its just me but that can get pretty annoying. Last I wish we were able to use this app on devices like computers. It can be a great way to manage things and send streaks without having to be on a phone. But other than that that’s it I recommend the app heavily.
"This exact situation has happened to many people for no reason, and snapchat support is entirely useless as an option to get any help with this issue and others. My account got permanently locked randomly while I was at work. The reason why is completely unknown to me to this very day, knowing for a fact I didn’t violate any of the terms. Trust me I tried everything to get it back. I went through snapchat support and found out they don’t have a single support number or anything useful whatsoever for the hundreds on hundreds of other people who as well been put through this same situation. And better yet, they also threw in a device ban. So any attempts to make a new account is impossible unless you buy a new phone, get a new number, everything. Snapchat NEEDS to step up and resolve this issue. The majority of us did absolutely nothing to violate any of snapchat’s terms. Lost nearly 6-7 years of memories. Some of college, all through high school and junior high into my childhood including contact with dozens of my online friends all gone. For such a large platform and the potential to be a great app, you’d expect better from the creator and the snapchat “support team”. Disappointing and ridiculous."
"i’ve had snapchat for a long time and really enjoyed it at first but it’s gone downhill a lot and things that don’t need to be changed, are being completely ruined. for example, the way stories were set up, the way you view the map, the things you see on another persons profile, etc is all different and in my opinion, worse than it was before. so many unnecessary updates and changes are ruining the app. for a lot of people, myself included, this is one of our main forms of communication but i have been tempted to delete many times because you can barely do anything on the app anymore without everyone else knowing (example: notifications for EVERYTHING…screenshots, viewing location, viewing profile, etc). the app also glitches and/or crashes very frequently causing people to think you left them on read or delivered for weeks when in fact the app just didn’t work the way it was supposed to.
my advice to snapchat: stop making unnecessary changes (except maybe let us change our usernames) and instead work on making sure your app is working correctly and not crashing every other day"
"Snap is hands down the best social media platform atm imo for ease of use, main use, and story page. It replaces iOS messages for me I snap text more than iOS text I really like the app along with the story/pinned page but the ads are atrocious it wouldn’t be bad if it wasn’t the exact same ad back to back 7 times after 3 slides of a story that kills the app. Also I used to use snap on my iPad and that is absolutely tragic I have to 2x zoom in to use snap regularly instead of it being an iPhone sized app on an iPad Air (this isn’t an issue with me now tho since I got an iPhone). There’s also major performance issues now tho with one my snap wouldn’t load it would boot me to home screen Everytime. Uninstalled then reinstalled. Now it says check connection try again so I closed out the app and tried again and same message so I’m not quite sure what to do I just reinstalled for the 2nd time hopefully it works. All around it’s still my favorite social media since vine died (RIP) cause I can see Reg news Youtuber news and just random interesting pages while also using it as a main source of comms with people."
"snapchat is by far my favorite app on my phone. and even though i love it i have my problems. snap is so glitchy and buggy. sometimes i get snaps from people but they won’t show up as if they snapped me. and then like a few hours or even days later i’ll get the snap, and as an avid user of snap i’d like to be able to use it without that. and i read these reviews and they keep saying add a way we’re they can’t see what you screenshot. please do not, i personally know i would HATE if someone screenshotted something i sent and i didn’t know until it circled back to me. also i’ve been using snapchat to mostly take photos and videos of myself and my videos/photos come out blurry. at first i thought it was my phone since i have the iphone 7 but it’s not that. because my friends have older phones than mine and there’s works better. so that the videos should come out how they look in the edit tan and not change when adding to your story. also you should change the update and make the snap map go back to swiping up not the the left. it gets annoying being used to swiping in convos and now i swipe into the map."
So I’ve had snapchat for almost 4 years now and I’m just getting more and more disappointed. When I first got snapchat I really liked how it looked and the the icon had not such a bold out line. And it was different layout. So I’m not saying that any app should never update itself but think about what people want upadated and make changes to that. Anyway u guys updated the app and the whole layout changed I didn’t really like how it looked at first but I got use to it and then liked it. But then u guys changed the whole layout again this year and I hate it. I’m not against androids but that’s what it looks like and it just looks weird for an app to look like that. So there’s one thing. Then the next problem I’m having is that my friends are Apple to send multiple snaps bc it says on there phone under like the little drop bar down option they have a little multiple photos thing but I don’t. And I would really like to use it but ever since I updated the app I’ve been unable to find it. So I’m not saying I hate this app and would get rid of it but I think that there should be more tests run and maybe do a survey of what people would want changed about the app so they can still enjoy the app.
"I love snapchat. The only thing I would change about it is the fact that your memories get deleted immediately after you press “delete,” which makes your photos and videos impossible to retrieve if it was an accident that you hit “delete” instead of one of the other options. I had a video that I was meaning to save to my camera roll so that I could post it on my Instagram page, but my finger accidentally went to “delete” instead of “export.” After realizing what had happened, I searched the internet for a long time, over the course of two days, trying to find out if there was some way I could retrieve the lost video, but to no avail. I wish snapchat had a “Recently Deleted” folder somewhere like the iPhone photos app does, so that if you accidentally delete a memory that meant a lot to you, you could still get it back. I am very upset that it doesn’t seem I will be able to retrieve this video, and because of one accidental click. Disappointed and also frustrated that Snapchat doesn’t seem to shed any light on this topic"
"i love snapchat personally because of the quick communication and i’ve made 100’s of friends from the app. there are a few things i need to get straight though... the first thing is updates, i have the iphone x and most of my friends have the iphone 11 so you might be thinking what the problem is well my friends have the newer design of snapchat that has been recently changed and my phone which is kind of an older phone has not updated. i know plenty of people who have a older phone like me and we haven’t gotten any important updates besides bug fixes. i don’t know why snapchat you’re only picking newer phones to be updated and be faster but i have enough and you guys need to put an update for all phones any kind. the second thing is bug fixes; it is not necessary to be sending out bug fixes if it’s not fixing anything... remember new years 2020 when the app wouldn’t work for anyone and it was about to be midnight and you guys can’t get your act together and fix it is pretty ridiculous. i mean i love the app and all of my memories but there are large and small things that you guys can fix. 
-AO"
"I started using Snapchat around the end of 2016....(I must admit, rather sheepishly at that,..
That I’d say after a month or 2 of taking all my selfies with the filters, I am *literally* unable to go back to taking photos *W/O* using them..😂
It’s a bit funny, a bit pitiful, a bit sad, a bit lame....probably sounds silly I would imagine  lol.  I genuinely enjoy all of the creative filters though, truly....So it’s probably a moot point that my self esteem has been seriously jacked around where I’ve found myself questioning, (upon seeing my face in the mirror, (or anywhere, that isn’t snap, along with the filters...) if I was seriously * ALWAYS* this ugly.....or if my judgement/perception is truly just incredibly skewed, ...as now it’s been nearly *4* straight years,...& objectively I could see that being a realistic fact....Anyway...neither is *GOOD* obvs....but of course I would much rather it be the latter of the 2 if I had to pick! 😳
Anyway...I realize this is the app reviews, (as opposed to weekly group therapy) 😂...
I had more to mention, but whatever it was has since escaped me, so I’ll end it here for time being. 😋❤️"
I’m about ready to delete and stop using snapchat because it has gotten so bad it’s to a point where you can’t even search for people you already have added. Plus it’s too much promoted content. I would pay for a version that didn’t have all the extra promoted stuff nobody downloads snapchat for that. They download it to communicate with their friends and watch what their friends post and talk to them. Snapchat has been on a big decline and just when I thought it couldn’t get any worse it did. Goodbye snapchat! Maybe I’ll come back when you get your act together but right now the app is more frustrating than it is enjoyable so I don’t think I’ll be using it for a while and I’m sure everyone else feels this way because everyone I know sure does. Used to be a 5 star app but now it doesn’t deserve more than 1 or 2 starts at most. I’m very disappointed. If I could choose what version to go back to I would choose to go back to when it was just messaging and snaps with an entire page dedicated to story’s organized alphabetically whit new ones at the top. And it was cool to be able to see who someone else’s best friend was. #makesnapchatgreatagain
"I LOVE Snapchat and I’ve had snapchat since 2013 because it’s such a good way to meet new people and stay in touch. It’s my most used app and I enjoy snapchatting people all day long. But recently I’ve been kind of fed up with the bugs. Like when I get a notification from Snapchat, sometimes it’ll just disappear off my lock screen. Also when I open the app after I got a notification, the Snapchat will not appear. The most annoying bug is when the Snapchat says, “Tap to Load” but when I tap it won’t load and I’ll never see the Snapchat. I’ve looked up how people have fixed these bugs in the past and I’ve tried everything. I’ve tried restarting my phone, deleting the app and download it again, I've logged in on another phone, I’ve cleared the conversation, and I’ve cleared my cache but nothing seems to work. Another thing, it is very hard to reach Snapchat. I had to really work to find how to reach them and tell them about their bug and I feel like it needs to be a little easier. Again, I love snapchat and as a teenager it is perfect for my generation to keep up with each other but I am really disappointed in all the bugs recently. Thanks!!"
I keep getting Snapchat is a Camera app go to settings to fix this I go to settings to fix it it has no option of fixing it so I delete it I log back into my account and then it keeps giving me the same thing and now I can’t get it back on because my tablet doesn’t have enough space so I delete random apps I don’t use but it still doesn’t let me download it so I have no way of reaching my friends my mom and dad no I am up so I’m gonna keep trying to download it until it finally downloads other than half of that I love the app it’s a really good app me and my friends we talk about it and we play Roblox calling with it! We take snaps with each other and it’s just a really good app all the bugs Snapchat if you’re reading this: please fix your bugs and please please get rid of all the allows every time I read download it it keeps getting more annoying Thank you so much for reading my review! :D have a good rest of your day/night/evening! bye :) <3
"When I first got Snapchat it was great, worked very well and they’re wasn’t anything I didn’t like about it. I did notice though, that I couldn’t send videos. I would have to save them and then send the video to the person/people through the chats. Even then they still didn’t send. And recently, I lost all of my saved memories - I did follow the steps you left in the help section about lost memories and I got them back for a little while, but they’re gone again and those steps no longer work.
        Also, every time I go to open Snapchat, it shuts me out of it. I found that I have to shut down my phone for a few minutes, and delete an app on my phone to stay in the Snapchat for a little bit. I’m sorry if this sounds like I’m complaining, or unhappy with your app, I really do love it, but I would appreciate it if you might try to fix these issues. I’m not the only one with this problem, some of my friends have this problem too with their Snapchat just shutting them out of the app and not letting them reopen it, and we would really appreciate it if that was checked out. Thank you so much!"
"I personally love this app and it’s a great way to text and chat and do lots of things on honestly! I have a few issues with it though. One is that when I go to a chat and press the smile face I can’t find the cutout thing to make a cameo. I’ve been looking left and right how to. I’ve been asking my friends and everything they tell me is not showing up on my screen. For example they said to update Snapchat and then maybe I’ll see the cutout so I updated it and honestly nothing changed. I can’t find how to make a cameo. My friend has even sent me a link to Snapchat support saying how to make a cameo but I am missing on of those steps. I don’t have the face cut out image on the bottom of my bar when I press the face. I have one more issue. The only snap game that I can’t play is Bitmoji party. Me and my friends are always trying to play bitmoji party together and hers works and mine doesn’t. Everytime I try playing, before I even start the game, it says connection lost. EVERY TIME! So I would love if you could fix the bitmoji party and I know that it is not my connection because I have strong connection. Thanks for reading."
"i love everything about snapchat but one thing i can’t stand is going through you subscription story’s and seeing a interesting story’s that end up being 20 pages, but i’m complaining about the ads all around the screen, they make everything so glitchy. now i know this isn’t really snap chats problem but i hope they can make my time on their app more stress free by making it smooth and not frustratingly hard to read a article. look i was just talking a Urbo how many times will you fall in love quiz and me going through the questions when the page is super glitchy and it makes me click the wrong answer and then i can’t change it and has to restart, this is ridicules. then i finally got through almost all the questions and was at the final question and the screen went white. i tried to do anything in my power to save the progress but it didn’t do anything and i lost it. i just wanted a simple answer to how many times i would fall in love because snap chat hasn’t yet fixed this problem i felt the right to report this. and i know giving snap chat a one star is not the best thing to do if i love everything else in the app but i hope this will be seen and fixed as soon as possible so i can take my quizzes quick and smooth. Thank you"
"So I had downloaded Snapchat as a way to talk to my friends and after awhile of figuring out how to use it, I found discover. Now I love the spotlight feature because I don’t have TikTok, but the discover one… that’s another story. I can’t really say I enjoy discover, mainly because of the ads. I know that’s how you make money, but Snapchat approximately has a net worth of 25 billion dollars, so I wouldn’t say you necessarily need to shove  an ad in the viewers face every 10 seconds. I was watching discover and after about 3 ads within the time span of 15 seconds, seconds not minutes, I decided to write a review because of the fact that this happens all the time and it’s just crazy. You want people to download your app and use it but when you throw ads at people every five seconds it can kinda drive people away like it did with me. I would appreciate, and I’m sure lots of other people would too, if you cut down on the ads. It seems like Snapchat is already doing pretty well and if you want to keep up with that then your best bet would to, uh not drive people away. Just a suggestion, otherwise, works fine and smoothly."
"Today my friend and I where walking down the street and we noticed a phone. The phone had six apps on it. Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and Photos. We had went through the phone and noticed many horrifying pictures of underage children. They were all taken by snapchat. We are honestly so disappointed that this company has gotten the point of this and I understand you can’t control what the users post. I would expect a app with this many children having access to stuff that you guys would at least have a filter on the app. My children can easily download this app and friend people that they don’t know. Even as a parent with many concerns for their child knows they will find way to get away with anything. Again we understand the fact that you can’t control what your users say or post but please find a way to have a child proof setting. My kids love the filters that you guys provide and we aware that there are other apps we could use but they just aren’t the same. My husband and I have so much trust with our kids and expect so much out of them!!!-from our beautiful family🤍"
"Snapchat, you know how you added the group chat system a while back? There needs to be one change to it. We should have the ability to remove someone from a group. Here’s why:

Okay, so, I decided that I wanted to make a group chat with my friends and use it to share stories as a way to get closer. I made the mistake of inviting one friend, however, as she would make the most ridiculous and inconvenient calls in the middle of the night. Not only that, but, she wasn’t using the system of MY chat as I intended. She abuses my group chat as she posts multiple pictures, despite me asking her to stop. That friend later says I yelled at her, then creates drama for everyone and keeps us all up in the middle of the night. That girl later posts something I call very disturbing, and the sad things are, for one, I couldn’t delete it, and the fact people were literally online, on my group chat, and saw that. Now what are they gonna think of me? I’ve had enough of it to the point I left the group chat. I got fed up, ok?

Snapchat, PLEASE make this change right now, and I’ll give you a five star rating. Thanks for your time in reading this (if you did so already)."
"I’ve been on Snapchat for 6 years and never had an issue it’s a part of my every day life and every picture and video I’ve ever taken for the past 6 years have been under this app, not anymore now that Snapchat wants to delete my account forever it’s gone and never coming back over nothing won’t give me a reasoning and even worst just logs me out without giving me a warning or time to save my memories!? This is terrible I’ve never been so distraught in my life my whole life was on that app and Snapchat will not contact me or help me at all with getting my account back it’s jus gone like that. And we can’t do anything about it because we agreed to terms that Snapchat can jus go into your account and terminate you whenever then please for no reason do not use this app because it will be a nightmare after years of using it I wish this didn’t happen I always loved this app and now it is the death of me if I could give this a 0 I would this app should be deleted w out warning and ppl  get all their videos and pictures taken down thag was my entire camera roll it’s been months and I still cry about it as we speak I have no picture or videos on my phone because it’s new all my stuff was on Snapchat"
"I’ve used snapchat almost since it came out awhile ago. With time it has improved so much with less and less glitches etc. However, recently I’ve had multiple friends get their entire accounts deleted with no warning or possible way to get their account retrieved. With my generation we rely on Snapchat to hold our memories in “memories” safely. With these account deletions many people have lost the last 5 years of their lives. It has completely vanished and Snapchat has responded with a short message about how they can’t do anything. My suggestion is that when Snapchat wants to delete accounts there needs to be some sort of warning and/or confirmation that the accounts in question are no longer in use. I think this would save a lot of problems and keep your users in a better mindset. As this hasn’t happened to me personally (yet) I’ve witnessed my friends going through this which terrifies me, as well as makes me feel sad for their loss of hundreds and thousands of memories. Thank you for your time. I really really would like to see this fixed."
"Hello! I totally love  snapchat, it's a great way to communicate with friends and people in general, and a great way to meet new people, but there IS a small feature you can add. So basically, in order to screenshot the chat, you have to request to the person. For example, if I were talking to my friend and wanted to screenshot the chat, I would screenshot but before it adds to my camera roll my friend gets a request asking if I can screenshot the chat. EX: Emily has requested to screenshot this chat! ) And I have another recommendation, we should be able to organize our memories category. For example, you can add a section named anything you desire that will be at the top and you can add or remove any photos, like an album, and we can also have shared albums with friends too that you can invite friends to share an album with selected memories and others you add to the story can add their own memories too. EX: Emily has added to your shared album, [Name]. 

Thank you for listening/reading!"
"Snapchat is notorious for not listening to their users. Everybody knows this. But snapchat is growing old. We all want something new. For starters, it’s high-time Snapchat joins the dark mode team. I don’t want the light from chats glaring in my eyes at night. Secondly, stories used to be so simple but now I can never find my friends’ stories. There is WAY too much going on with the interface. It’s too confusing, too complex. People like simple. Third, bring back best friends. Snapchat has become so exclusive. We want to know what are friends are up to and it’s all so closed off. Bring back best friends and just make it optional. You guys never listen to users. Snapchat is tired. So much needs changed. Giving 3 stars because it went from a simple, fun app to confusing. I don’t even check the right side of Snapchat because it’s just filled with “recommendations” that I don’t want to see and people I DON’T know. What is even going on on the right side of Snapchat? We have stories on the left but then on the right too? Except the right shows me stories of people I can never find. What sense does that make? Highly irritated. It’s just too much."
"i read some reviews and realized i wasn’t the only person with this annoying problem. i get into Snapchat and do whatever until like 15-25 maybe 30 minutes it my screen turns black and kicks/glitches me out of the app. otherwise the app is fun, i don’t really take pictures i scroll through the “movies” on there, Hooked, stuff like that and it’s entertaining and i use that app a lot. it’s not too bad with the glitching out but idk if it’s my device or snap because i heard it’s happening to other people. so if it’s snap at least try to fix it because i don’t want it to get worse like i can’t even do anything without it doing that. try and don’t ignore people because most very annoying i don’t use it too much but for people who use it for hours it’s gonna get frustrating. also the little paragraph/story stuff there are WAYY too much ads, and pressing next 4,078 should be enough. but no. and most of the time i just leave the story bc the screen just randomly goes white, has to load whatever. i’m lucky if i get to finish which happened like 2 times. please fix these problems otherwise it’s fine thanks for reading my review ik it’s long but whatevah sistah."
"okay so the past 2 days my snapchat has been acting weird. i mean sure this complaint is not really a big of a deal but i just can’t get use to this issue. i cant see when my friends are in the chat and when they’re not because i cant see their bitmoji’s but it does give me a notification that this particular person is typing its just that whenever i go to the conversation i don't see him/her typing or there at all even if they are there. at first it was tolerable but then it got worse when i couldn’t even figure out whether or not they have opened my snaps or messages because there were some points that i know they’ve seen it but it’s just not saying it’s been opened. i have tried every solution i could think of to fix this glitch or bug or whatever but nothing worked. i’ve tried logging out then logging back in of snapchat, deleting the app then reinstalled it again, and resetting my phone. i dont know what else to do. so please if you can at least give me an update for the app i’d be very glad. thank you."
"snapchat has become so unbelievably unreliable now, it’s been kicking me in and out of snapchat, my friends and families snapchat’s have been deleted and lost all of their memories. i currenlty am not allowed into my snapchat unless it’s once every other day. tried contacting them and they still tell me they can’t do anything, i’m four years outta high school. i have all of my prom, homecoming, celebrations, and even my own graduation pictures. i have endless counts of videos of my puppies. and my cousins wedding. i counted on snapchat as a storage device where I can still take pictures and save them onto the app without storing it in my phone and using all of my gigabytes for pictures I’ve had Snapchat for over six years and this is the first biggest issue I’ve ever had with them I am so unbelievably disappointed in  Snapchat to the point that they won’t fix it. it is happening to so many more people across the world and they still won’t do anything about it they are currently being hacked and they still won’t do nothing to prevent it from happening again letting all their customers get frustrated and delete the app to where they cannot make money anymore. fix your app snapchat. this has been going on for over a week now."
"I’m very disappointed with the app, terms of service , and lastly the people who run the app. A few months ago someone reported a snap and Snapchat deleted my entire account. I’ve had the account for over 7years prior to being reported. Snapchat didn’t give me a warning, a reasoning of why it was deleted, and fails to provide me any of the memories that was on the account. The video that was reported did not violate any of the terms of service and it was bull for Snapchat to delete my account. It’s frustrating me that I pretty much lost access to 7 years worth of footage. I never imagined my Snapchat getting deleted so I never felt the need to save everything to my camera roll. I wouldn’t recommend this app because once something like this happens, all of yours memories are gone. Women and men sit up and post pornographic images etc pretty much everything that’s a violation to terms of service all of the time and for my stuff to be reported, it doesn’t sit well with me. I’m more upset that my memories are gone from graduations, birthdays, vacations etc. I want to say Snapchat from the bottom of my heart, change the way you treat your users before the lack of respect cause this platform to become the next MySpace."
"Honestly I just would like my whole Snapchat account back because I posted a bunch of pez candy and I was so so excited about this candy, not thinking straight I posted them joking about pills and immediately got my Snapchat deleted. Over a joke…over candy. Yes it was an honest mistake. I just spent over 70 dollars on straight up candy. I genuinely felt like a kid again. And now it seems I can’t get my account back or any of those photos in my memories. 5 years of pictures and videos lost. I’m so extremely sad that a small joke I made lead up to this. I find it absolutely insane that over my mistake too I’m completely banned from Snapchat now. It’s seriously not fair. Y’all don’t even have any support people to help or talk to. You would think that this app is so big that they would have a support system to help with things like this and they don’t. I’m literally at the mercy of this app and it’s creators. I’m honestly here BEGGING for my mistake to be forgiven. It was literally candy. I would have never posted that if I knew it would’ve led to this. Please. It was a honest mistake over a ton of pez candies. Please."
"I usually don’t do reviews, but I’m really starting to get annoyed with the “next page” “next page” next page” “next page” “next page” story pages. The stories are really interesting, but eventually I will click next page and for some reason the page will just glitch and show a white page or pop up an ad that I can’t get out of except to press the “x” and after that, I don’t feel like scrolling all the way through the numerous “next page” buttons and ads, and therefore cannot finish the story that had already hooked my attention and I was almost done with.  It’s been doing this for about a year or more. Eventually I just don’t even want to read the stories that writers spent their time writing. I have an iPhone XR and I am connected to internet that has never gave me any issues. Plus, like I said.. it has been going on for a long while now and I’ve been on numerous devices and connected to numerous WiFi connections. That said, the problem is most definitely stemming from the application. Please take this problem into consideration as I really enjoy this Snapchat feature, I just wish I could actually finish the stories that I have already invested my time into reading."
Okay where do I start.. Snapchat is an amazing app because you can FaceTime and text your friends if you or your friends don’t have minutes on your phone. Also I love the filler’s and I like how you can block people  if the are being rude I’ve had to do that a couple of times.. and I like how you can save chats just in case someone is being rude to your friends they if you save them you can show your friends what the person has been saying about them. And now let’s talk about updates..ever since the update my Snapchat isn’t working as well as it was but it still works good and sometimes it pops up that I have know filler’s. BUT  it is because I never refresh my Snapchat😂 So remember if something weird happens alway refresh your Snapchat DON’T  be like me and never refresh your Snapchat... so that was just a little story that happened to me about a week ago😂 but yes Snapchat is amazing oh and another thing do not add strangers.. trust me I done that but let’s not even go there😬😬 And yes if you are aloud I recommend you getting Snapchat👻👻 bye
"I absolutely love Snapchat just like millions of others around the world including most of my close friends, but recently I find multiple people I know losing their accounts they’ve had for years. Snapchat holds thousands of memories for me and others. The app keeps so many memories of mine that I forget even existed. It holds so many important things. But many of my friends accounts have been hacked and Snapchat’s security is not well maintained. Two of my friends who had updated their emails, passwords , and numbers to their Snapchats still unfortunately had gotten hacked and locked out of their accounts and snap chat has done nothing to get them back making it to where they had to start all over again. Losing so many memories and pictures they held near and dear. I would like Snapchat to make hacking into others account harder to do by updating their security. I don’t want anyone else to have this happen to them as well as myself."
"I was off snapchat for three months and when i got it back, my account was completely disappeared. I was like “oh well might as well make a new account.” So i tried making a new one, and it kept saying stuff like cannot connect so i waited until i had wifi. I made an account on wifi then when i logged in it was immediately banned. I went to the account unlock page but they wouldn’t tell me why i got banned nor would they let me unlock the account. So i made another and every single one i made got banned upon log in. I told some friends so they told me to try VPN. I added on a good VPN to my phone thinking my IP address was banned or something but it did the exact same thing and i could not make an account . So i factory reset my phone and tried again but it didn’t work, so the last thing i thought of was like a completely new apple id and what not so maybe snap would think that the phone had a new user?? Idk. But even with factory reset, VPN , etc, my phone cannot make an account without getting banned. I can’t get a new phone yet so🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ It’s been almost 8 months and i cannot use snapchat. Fix this so i don’t have to buy a new phone just bc all my friends use snap it’s extremely annoying"
"I use Snapchat a lot to access my support system and they banned my account when I went through a serious panic attack. Without access to my super system, my life could have ended that night. I'm bulimic and have body dysmorphia so I asked Snapchat to stop showing me ads for fat reduction treatments and they emailed me back saying I could disable a certain setting and that's all I could do. Doing this had no impact on the ads they were showing me. Snapchat also advertises scam businesses that have you send money for a product then never send the product and refuse to take any calls or emails. Snapchat does not check out the ads they show on their site and result in people getting scammed and having worsened mental health and confidence. If you have mental health issues or body dysmorphia, Snapchat is not the app for you it is not safe at all. They will lock your account after giving you a warning even if you stop doing what you were doing before. They don't make the terms very clear without reading a ridiculous amount of stuff and then penalize you after reading it and following the rules. Snapchat does not have mercy on people and could play a hand in people's deaths and mental health."
"I love this app. I think it’s a great way to be able to communicate with my friends and family. I haven’t had really any problems with it except for 2 things. First I think that the updates should be released to everyone. My snapchat still looks the same with the blue or purple at the top, but a lot of my friends have the new all white look. I like the blue and purple top, but I think the new look should be released to everyone or better yet, be an option in settings how you want your snapchat to look. My second big problem is, is when I go to edit someone’s name, I can’t, for example, add a letter in the middle of their name without having to delete the whole name. The cursor won’t stay between letters, and just seems to go to the beginning or end of the name, which is a huge inconvenience, especially if I’m just adding a letter or emoji to the beginning of they’re name to indicate that I have a streak with them, or if I’m just trying to delete that emoji/and or letter. Otherwise I love this app, except for the reasons above and the minor crashes we’ve been experiencing lately..."
"I have been the biggest fan of snapchat for 5 years now. I’ve had my account forever and I’ve never had any issues. That was until this weekend when I was completely logged out of my account and locked out of it for no reason. I did not violate a single term of service, download any third party apps, or spam anyone. So my account was locked for absolutely no reason. I emailed customer service about my problem and they sent me a link to unlock my account. I used this link and now my account is permanently locked. I then emailed them about 5 times trying to get some help to save my account but they didn’t respond once. I called Apple to try and help but there’s nothing they could do and this is entirely an issue on Snapchat’s part. Their customer service team is absolutely useless and it’s disturbing that I cannot even get one person to email me back. So I made a new account to try and start over and move on. This account was doing great until it was logged out and locked out for no reason again. I literally have no idea what to do and have now lost all of my memories and way to communicate with people. I’m beyond upset and will not stop emailing their lousy support team until this is fixed."
"I’ve had this app for YEARS and have never had this problem occur until yesterday. So...a basic run down of how it happened...I tried to post to my story, and it kept saying “failed to post” or whatever so I tapped retry, and it posts...for like half a second until I close the app and reopen it...then it does the same thing. So now I got a ten second story that was supposed to be a minute long in total....and the rest of the videos are gone because I didn’t save them because I didn’t think I had too..anyways...onto the next problem...I wake up this morning and try to look at my other friends stories...and it won’t play theirs either...it’ll play their old ones that I’ve already seen but none of the new ones that they’ve posted in the last hour or so. Plus it keeps recycling the same persons story when I try to click through them to get to the next person. I’m not sure if it’s an update error or if it’s a minor bug but I would really like for it to be cleared up soon. Other than these two recent problems I haven’t had any issues with the app! It’s great in total I just think something went wrong in the recent update!"
"per the title, i used snapchat for 3 years and had AMAZING memories i captured solely on snap and had tons of friends i used to know and talk with only on snap with the most efficient way to communicate as such. randomly, about two days ago, they ‘temporarily’ locked me out of my account. in that manner, i was confused and followed the instructions to get it unlocked on the website. but when i went on the website and tried to unlock it, it said it was ‘permanently’ locked on the website. i was appalled as it says two different things on two different platforms. i contacted snap support and they gave a reply in one second for each of my seven emails on how they can’t help with a locked account. so there lies all my memories, some memories even being the last one for some people i knew; i cant see it again. Snap ruined my three years of memories and my friends contacts over no reason of locking my account. I wish I could give a star lower, as snap will literally lock you out for no reason and make you lose everything you have in there. don’t get snap, don’t fw it. use a camera roll instead and send those pics in a different contact instead of snap as snap WILL lose your memories."
"I’ve had my Snapchat account since 2016, never had issues. Up until last month a bunch of people including me got kicked out and weren’t able to log in for about an hour or so. When I did get back into my account, it was super slow, snaps wouldn’t send or load. Then last night as I’m texting a friend I get logged out. When I tried logging back in it said my account was locked. Which makes no sense to me because I have not went against community guidelines. Due to that I have lost contacts and photos from over 5 years ago. I think this is ridiculous and Snapchat needs to do something about this. I am not the only one neither. I know two other people that got deactivated last night and they as well have never said nor posted anything wrong or against your guidelines. Now I’m forced to loose all pictures, contacts, and not able to create a new Snapchat. If I could give this a zero star rating I would because these last few months Snapchat has been going downhill, and fast. All I have to say left is if you use this app I’d make sure you saved all photos to your camera roll and got your contacts in your phone. Otherwise years of memories and friends are going to down the drain 🤷🏼‍♀️"
"Ever since the newest update my snapchat crashes after 30 seconds of being on it. I have tried everything and nothing seems to work. I tried deleting and redownloading the app, i have refreshed the app, cleared it, shut my phone off and then back on. I have lost all of my streaks due to this app crashing and its very frustrating i love my streaks and im disappointed in the app. I love snapchat its my favorite app on my phone but as of right now its the crappiest app on my phone. I updated it and was a little iffy on if i wanted to update it only because my bestfriend is having the same issue she had hers set up to automatically update her apps and hers has been crashing since the day it updated. As soon as i open the app it and go to send a snapchat its freezes up and then the screen goes black and it takes me back to my home screen...not only that but it logs me out of my account out of nowhere i changed the password thinking someone else was logging in mine but thats not it... it still logs me out. Not to mention The new icon is too bold and ugly now. ive had snapchat since 2013 and ive only had one other issue with an update untill now. Can you please fix this issue i know im not the only person thats having this problem. Thank you"
"Okay so recently our family has had a WiFi problem, no big deal. We got it fixed and everyone is hooked up now. So just a few days ago, I went into snap to reply to a few people who sent videos... I CANT OPEN THEM. So I’m like okay maybe if I just restart my phone or clear the cache I can open them. No. Still cant do that. Then I went through my entire snap list to open them and reply to them when I can’t even reply to certain people’s snaps!!! It won’t let me open them. I’ve tried almost everything. I also cannot use filters because when I try to, it just says ‘Loading’ and they won’t ever load. This has still happened even when I’ve had 4 bars of WiFi. I also can’t open certain people’s stories too. Let’s just say I click on someone’s story. It will skip it and take me to someone else’s. Then it will show that I viewed it and I can’t ever view the story without it showing a black screen and exiting me out! I don’t know if anyone has experienced this bug before but it’s REALLY frustrating. I’m just trying to use the app for its purpose. Again I wish I could rate it 5 stars, but lately there’s just too many problems that make the app a lot more frustrating. Please fix this major bug."
"Yes, sometimes there are bugs and glitches. Yes, there are a few things that the developers could add, edit, or change. Yes, there are annoying ads and features things. But, you guys need to look at the big picture. This is one of the most amazing, and revolutionary applications that have ever been released. More people might use Facebook, but this app is far greater than any other social media platform. You guys need to stop giving anything other than 5 stars just because you’re upset that you ran into a bug or a glitch that lasted for less than 24-48 hours. Snapchat deserves a 100% review/rating, by FAR. It is very likely the most amazing platform ever created. If they were able to develop a version that could utilize Windows, macOS, etc.. then it would be GAME OVER for every other social media platform in the world. So, if you like Snapchat due to bugs/glitches, like every other application in the universe, then stop using it. This idea deserves nothing but 5 stars."
"I love the primary function of Snapchat. But there should be options to customize a feed. For instance, some people (although I’ve never met them) probably like official stories and enjoy seeing them. Someone like me who hates official stories and thinks that they are biased, misleading, complete wastes of time and that they lower millions of IQs every day, would appreciate an option to hide all official stories because I don’t care about celebrities, crazy people seeking validation or loudmouths trying to get my attention. I just want to communicate with my friends. You might respond “oh, you can hide stories you don’t like”. Well I tried hiding all stories I don’t like but more kept popping up in the “Discover” section, stories that I hated even more. Just make an option to hide official stories, it’s that simple. I’m talking an option to completely hide them from the app. I think I’ll probably delete Snapchat sooner if nothing changes and I hope you realize it’s a shame that you’re indoctrinating young people like me with the most mind-numbing, useless content around. On a positive note, you do have at least one good official story: “Snapped in the Wild”. Who cares about some brainless instagram model when you can watch animals rip each other to shreds. Thanks."
"I have been using Snapchat for years, I love using it as another way to keep in touch with my friends and family. Snap stories are great ways to show current events in your life without creating a post like other social media applications. 

So now for the ugly...

In December of last year, I rewarded myself with an upgrade of an iPhone 11 Pro from an 8 Plus. After a storage upgrade, this phone cost me well over $1,200. The greatest feature of the 11 Pro? The amazing, triple-lens camera. At events and gatherings, my phone is the phone of choice for taking pictures. As it should be. The camera on this phone is truly amazing. Apple hit the nail on the head with the triple lens camera. What isn’t amazing? The fuzzy, grainy photos that Snapchat creates with the 11 Pro camera. Looking at the screen before taking a picture, the quality doesn’t look bad, but once the shutter is pressed and the photo is taken, the exposure automatically jumps high, makes blacks in the image appear grey and grainy. The photo looks like the result of an iPod Touch 4th generation camera using Snapchat. NOT GOOD. SNAPCHAT, PLEASE FIX THIS. CONSUMERS PAY GOOD MONEY FOR THEIR PHONES WITH GREAT CAMERAS AND AN APP BASED ON SENDING AND RECEIVING PHOTOS SHOULD NOT BE SUCH TERRIBLE QUALITY."
"My title can clearly tell what should happen next. No hate or anything like that, I’ve been using Snapchat for more than 2yrs now. I love how it is well organized with my saved photographs and videos throughout the years. But why aren’t we able to see the beginning of our conversation with someone unless we slide all the way up? If we use the small slide bar for old media then we should be able to see old conversations with that same slide bar. It just doesn’t make any sense because if we want to see anything specific we can just type in anything or use the slide bar. I like to look at old messages to remember good memories with those I talk to. Especially my boyfriend, we’ve been dating for over a year now and we talk every single day. But we ended up our app message to text each other. We can’t go back to see our conversation because we’ve texted a lot. Sadly we didn’t have the best phones and Snapchat was popular so of course we used it. I love Snapchat so much I don’t want to stop using it but I wanna see all my memories, not just old photos and pics. Please put a slide bar in conversations."
"It’s pretty annoying how you can only have some features on iPhones that you don’t have on androids. You can have more than one filter on iPhones and you can’t on androids. You can also pin comments on messages and see who saw you’re story that isn’t your friend, on iPhones. You can’t do that on androids. The discrepancy between both is pretty upsetting. I don’t think people with androids such be left out just because they have different devices. People with androids are missing out on being able to access these features. 
Also the new update is annoying. You’re making it more complicated than it should be. People really don’t care to follow influencers unless they actually like them. If they do, they’ll find them. There’s no reason to have like 2 pages added just to fill them up. I guarantee, people use Snapchat for their friends, not so much celebrities. It’s be great if the amount of space reserved for the stories of celebrities were actually used by our friends that we actually care to click on. Having my feed filled with people I don’t know is a waste of space. Do a survey and you’ll find this out real quick."
"This app is my all time favorite social media app. I use it daily to communicate with my friends and to “snap” lots of pics & memories that occur in my life. I have had this app for years and it has allowed me to not only connect with my friends but also meet new people. I love the filters it lets you use and it is a great platform to be able to post things or see what others are up to. I will say that it tends to have glitches & crash often (probably because of the amount of users using it!) but it is still my top social media app. If I’m being honest I spend most of my screen time on this app and find myself frequently checking it to see what my friends are up to. It’s also cool having the “snap map” to see locations of friends that have it turned on. One complaint I have is that I don’t like the amount of Ads when watching stories and I feel like as time goes on it just continues to add them more and more frequently making it super annoying. But, overall 9/10 app."
"it’s a really good app. i don’t know what these reviews are, because snapchat should have at least a 4.5 rating. There is nothing wrong with the app in my eyes. and, if you’re a parent reading this and wondering if you should get your kid the app, i think you should. it’s the child’s CHOICE to do bad things on it. Only add back the people you know and stay cautious etc etc. It’s a really good app i’m not sure what the complaints are, honestly i’m kind of bored waiting for it to update so i thought i would make this review after reading the negative ones. the only the negative ones are saying is how they don’t like the new logo or something, not REALLY about the app so like... sorry that you don’t like the logo or sum, we do. it doesn’t really matter the looks if you ask me , it’s a good app and a good way to connect with friends or family. that’s what i use it for. or to share to your story to show other what your doing!!! Like maybe you’re baking cookies!! anyway the app is amazing and i think who ever is reading this should download it."
Imma be reall whichu this update is trash-a-doodle-doo not like a scooby doo I’m serious right now I am a dayroom human being so if this trashy update gon stop me imma leave fr amd don’t you say good riddence cuz I’m a paying customer even tho it’s free listen to me dummy boi like the 6ix9ine album I betta listen up change that update right freakin now cuz u wanna slide open my d.ms on snap without people knowing cuz I’m dayroom so yea I wanna slide in like drakes toosie slide right foot up left foot slide u get it homie but fr fr I wanna be dayroom so I think it is pediatric that I can’t be dayroom WHY ARE YOU STOPPING ME I didn’t do anything wrong so please stop stopping me let me being dayroom this is the most horrible update I ever seen in snapchat don’t call me Karen for this rant call me a memer cuz I’m litty like that I can’t be dayroom I have changed cuz of this update and anyone who see this take a screen shot and repost on snap on insta on Facebook where ever u want so we can come together as a community and stop this nasty update I get nauseous looking at ok ya get it baiiii -Yarianna💋
"I’ve had snap since 2017 and I never really had an issue with it, last night I tried using it and it kept randomly closing on me. I left it alone for the night because usually the bugs and glitches work themselves if you give them time(for me personally); but this morning I tried to open the app again and it still kept closing on me. I tried restarting my phone, reinstalling the the app and everything. Nothing worked and I’m getting frustrated. It’s gotten to the point where I have to rush to answer people back or check stories.  I checked to see when the last update was and mine said four days ago and again this started last night, so I’m not sure if the update is the cause of this problem. I also thought I was the only one experiencing these problems but a few of my friends have said that the app has been closing on them too randomly. Anyways the only reason why I’m giving it three stars is because for about three years I never really had any issues with it. I honestly love Snapchat and it’s one of my most used apps on my phone. Please fix it."
"Okay first off I love Snapchat it’s amazing and fun! It’s a really easy and simple way to get ahold on my friends, and a easy way to see where they are and what there doing:) the filters are really funny, I love to get one of the really funny ones and put it on my friends faces with out them knowing..hehe😂! I also love love the filter ones!! That’s what I usually take my photos with, for my Instagram, and to send to my friends😫❤️ I love to scroll down threw my saved to see all the cringe, butttt funny memories that I’ve gotten to make. But lately snap has been getting really glitchy and it shows me snaps, storys, and chats that I’ve already opened and sometimes with out me even opening they GO AWAY! And it really upsets me, because what if it was really important, you know? Another problem is the streaks thing! I have like 30 but I lost my highest streak (344) and she had already sent streaks to me! And the other day me and my cousin were sending each other videos of each other cause we were right beside one another and it told us we lost our streak when we where just send photos/videos of each other!👎🏻😡"
"I want to say that Snapchat is a cool app to chat with friends and family! But there are some issues I have with the app. First, is my Friends. My Friends (with the bitmojis of my friends’) keeps on messing up. Like for example, it shows my 3 friends (including me) and I have to refresh the app sometimes. (btw I have more than 3 friends) Please fix this! Second, (this is not a bug but an issue) whenever I delete a chat it says ""YOU DELETED A CHAT"" and it gives me anxiety. Please remove this when you remove a chat. (I don’t mind the part that notifies my friend I deleted a chat) I just want the feature when I delete a chat this pops up on the chat. I don’t mind that the fact it notifies the person I deleted the chat. I want this to be removed, cuz it gives me stress and I am an organized person. Well, these are all my issues about the app that has been bugging me. 
Overall, this app is useable and fun and I consider to download the app! I use the app and it’s an amazing social media platform besides the bugs and cons. I recommend downloading!! ❤️"
"The chat textbox is way too short. There are five icons on that row, and only three are intuitive (camera, microphone, and smiley face). One icon is two rectangles overlapping each other (select photos), and one's a rocket ship. Yes, a rocket ship. How often am I going to be asking my friend to play a Snapchat game with me? Probably never, so why make the textbox smaller just for that meaningless icon? Instead of cluttering the chat textbox row and making the textbox a 1 inch wide oval, it would be nice if this mess of icons could be collapsed into a single menu to allow the chat textbox to take up most of the width of the screen so I can see what I'm typing. For reference, Discord's chat textbox takes up most of the width of the screen, and there are only three buttons there (attachment, emoji, send). Slack moves all those extra icons onto the next row so the chat textbox can be the full width of the screen minus one icon. Snapchat could do something similar to Discord and limit the chat textbox's row to having the diction button, emoji/bitmoji/etc, and photo (which would include camera, camera roll, and memories). The games button could be moved to the top of the screen next to the other infrequently used buttons."
"I had used Snapchat as my main social media app from 2016-present day, until the other day. While using the app, I was suddenly locked out (hacked?), then almost instantly received an email saying I was permanently locked out of my Snapchat account. With no rhyme or reason behind it, I was suddenly out of not just my Snapchat account but also thousands of memories dating back six years, groupchats with friends from high school now that we have all moved away and grown apart physically, and unable to create a new account. Snapchat really, truly, has been a pain to deal with as well during this process. They have no phone number to call, their emailing process is next to impossible to get a response, and their online forms to fill out always result in a “Our team cannot help with a permanently locked account.” With no understanding as to why or how I lost my account, memories, and ability to use the app, their support team completely disregards any need for “supporting” their consumers. I cannot believe the system that Snapchat has in place. This experience has been utterly horrible and I hope that leaving this review will result in Snapchat realizing this issue needs to be resolved."
"I love Snapchat it is an amazing app. It is great for texting your friends and sending them pictures or playing games. Although, lately it has been annoying me. As I said, I like to play the games. I like the ones where you open the front camera and then hold down to get the lenses and then when you swipe left you get to choose a game to play. I recently got an IPhone XR and when I try to play the games it’ll either not give me the option to play my next turn or it won’t let me click the play button. I always replay the snap in hopes that it’ll let me play but it never works. This never happened when I had my iPhone 7, so I’m thinking it has something to do with the fact that Snapchat is trying to adjust it to the new phone but I’m not to sure. I’m hoping that this will eventually be fixed so that I can continue to enjoy my experience. All this aside, I will continue to use the app because I love it and it is a good way for me to talk too friends. If you are thinking of downloading this app definitely do it."
"I have had Snapchat for about 5 years now and everything was fine but now nothing is working. I have had to delete the app every time I want to open a Snapchat otherwise the screen stays back for a few minutes and the app crashes. My streaks will mysteriously disappear even if both parties will send the multiple times a day. My snaps won’t send anymore and I can’t open them either. My memories are disappearing and I have to randomly re-enable applications such as my microphone, camera, photos, and location services. The app will randomly delete itself multiple times a day but it doesn’t do anything helpful. My Snapchat won’t let me post on my stories and I can’t view anyone else’s either. The app will randomly call people on my Snapchat who I haven’t talked to in months and then I get questioned on why I called them. I can’t save snaps anymore and the sticker application just doesn’t function. I love Snapchat or I actually should say loved, but recently in the last few months (February 2020 to May 2020) nothing works anymore. The new features are great and all but if the important ones just don’t work people won’t use the app. I’m disappointed and hope to see a change VERY soon."
"The little snap stories and shorts under “discover,” are 100% liberal-left. There’s complete bias in favor of the liberals who confuse liberty with licentiousness. They’re corrupting the minds of children who’s awful parents allow them to use it unsupervised. There’s a high level of sexualisation of teenagers with all the clearly underage girls in inappropriate clothing etc. In an attempt to have a modicum of decent content, I’ve “hidden” at least over a hundred stories, with no exaggeration, and it still keeps coming like an endless cesspool. There’s also racist content with shows like “Hello, White people,” where they explain to white people, who never held slaves, how to apologize for slavery, to people who were never slaves. I’ve seen stories where relationships between parent and child are portrayed as “isn’t this a quirky thing goin on, here’s how it happened!” As if it’s not objectively wrong, no matter how it happens. The first story suggested to me is from “Our Money,” with the title being “How to change assault culture one panty at a time...” as if you suggest there’s an accepted community with a culture of sexual assault... it’s gross, despicable, corrupt, immoral, manipulation of our youth. 

Do not let your children use this app."
"Out of nowhere I was switching from two account that I had. When all of sudden I tried logging into my main one where I’ve never had a problem with it. I have my phone, email and two step verification all setup and verified. When I was logging into my main one it log me in and showed the camera and then kicked me out into the logging screen. So I go to login and I get an error of “account temporarily locked” which I thought I was hacked. I check my mail for any email stating unknown login or someone trying to change my password and nothing. I go to there website to check what could be the issue for this and none of the stated “rules” had I broken. I’ve email them multiple times and they just sent you an automated message sending me to the same website of why I could have been possible locked out. I then try unlocking my account via a button they have but then it’s tells me my account has been “permanently locked.” I’ve tried getting in contact through twitter and no help whatsoever. Now I don’t know what to do all my memories since like 2016 are on my main snap and now I can’t get to them. I’m utterly disappointed with Snapchat and how they have the worst customer support."
"Snapchat is one of the best apps ever! It my most used app, it’s great for getting ahold of friends and even family. It the first thing I go to when I need to text my friends. You don’t just text but you can snap pictures too! It’s amazing! I have family that live all the way across the country, I can post on my story to keep them updated on what’s going on in my everyday life. If I didn’t have Snapchat let me tell you me and my family/friends would barely talk. Especially now in 2020 with COVID-19 I can group call all my friends and talk for hours. It an amazing app and I definitely recommend it for anyone. I know most parents with kids the age 13 and under are like “no Snapchat till your older” honestly I understand where your coming from but Snapchat is very safe. As long as you do your job as a parent and talk to them about not adding people they don’t know. And go over your rules, it’s a very safe app where nothing can go wrong. So yes I recommend  Snapchat to everyone!"
"I have so much anger and sadness in my heart for this app, I use it for my meme page(s), I run 4 at once because you keep banning like 1-2 of them at a time, I don’t spam, I don’t post gorey or suggestive content, as a matter of fact I’ve been non stop repeatedly banned from a acc with 500k snap score that I don’t even use because I was being spam reported for nothing, I’d like to go into more detail if I could get some sort of help or some level of compensation, it is so frustrating to want to keep in touch with someone and not do anything wrong and then get a email saying I’m locked out, your automated systems need either an update or need to be fully re-considered, I have gotten in touch with multiple accounts that have never broken community guidelines and yet get banned for extremely long or unecessary periods of time, I don’t get anything out of this I mean post memes for crying out loud, I just want to be able to keep going without having to worry with these problems, please strongly consider reaching out and helping me with my problems, I am willing to cooperate in any manner that you need me too, as long as I am heard."
"Snapchat is well known and a really great app to use I like the filters and many features but I think it will be useful if there’s was a new update where if you open snaps your Snapchat score also increases because most don’t want to open snaps for notification to act like they have a lot. But yet it can also save a life because someone could send you a snap saying “how horrible would you feel if I sent you a snap and as usual you would open it days and days later soon to find out I want to end it” I seen something like that on. Tik tok but what I’m really trying to say is that if it’s a way of getting your snap score up more people will actually be opening snaps to find out if someone is truly not doing okay in life. Also Snapchat has been acting up lately and it has been making my phone over heated as well. I’m sure most of us have these problems with the typing notification stuck on the screen, says opened/delivered or new chat when it really isn’t and won’t load at all into what’s actually happening."
"I’m telling you guys rn I’m NEVER DOWNLOADING THIS APP EVER AGAIN‼️‼️‼️‼️
I barely do anything on my account, I mainly have the app for the filters and post the videos or pics on my Instagram or Facebook but never anything outrageous on my Snapchat account... woke up one morning browsing thru Snap when all of a sudden I got logged out of my account then i received an email saying I’ve been locked out of my account... I got sooooooooooooo mad I couldn’t even think straight that morning, all of my pics and videos, GONE!!!!!!!! But I try not to make a big deal out it cause they’re saved to my camera roll anyways but still, c’mon Snapchat... and I even made a new one and still got locked out of my NEW account ....no matter what I do these “customers support” can’t even support me in getting my darn account back... all of my son’s baby pictures and my baby shower photos and videos are all there and now it’s all gone all because Snapchat won’t help me get access back to my account... they even send a website so you can “unlock” the account but that thing don’t even work like at this point don’t bother wasting your time downloading the app cause no one got time to keep making new accounts JUST TO BE LOCKED OUT"
"Hello Snapchat,

My phone just updated the snapchat app today. I was at work and was not using it, however was I have been using after work, the app is working less and less as time goes on. It began with glitching while taking videos, I’d just X and start over. Then I couldn’t watch videos that I received. It would say “Tap to load” then “Loading”, “tap to watch” then when I would click it would go directly back to “tap to load”. I tried closing the app, restarting my phone, nothing worked. I tried to log off of my account and back on, then the app would crash as I would hit log off, then when I would hit settings. Now the app won’t even load completely before crashing. I see a flash of my face then gone. I was going to report a big but since I can’t get to the settings page (as per what your website says) therefore, Here I am. I have a screen record to show some of the features. Sorry about the problems, never really had a problem with snap before and use it often. Thanks in advance!"
"i’ve had snapchat for numerous years and i have to say, it’s very annoying when snapchat constantly tries to update its layout. why should an app change the entire look of itself so many times each year! it’s unnecessary and stressing always having to adapt with the entire layout change. not only that, as of the new update i got in May i can’t half slide messages anymore! snapchat needs to focus on updating stuff that matter more like the everlasting bugs that is contained on the app no matter how many updates there are. my snapchat constantly takes me out the app, “cannot refresh” all the time, and sometimes won’t even let me save videos or pictures after it tells me it did, etc. snapchat also has no privacy for anyone. in my opinion it’s annoying having to always let it be known you read someone’s message, start typing and all. when you screenshot even down to how someone added you. there’s no way to do anything in privacy! what adds the cherry on top is that there’s no dark mode. a lot of more sensible updates can be made to this app to make it much more enjoyable for people."
This app used to be great till too much was changed and added that didn’t need to be there like bitmoji games barely anyone plays. Almost every update there is a new bug this time the pics in my camera roll when i click to look at them they all look extremely blurry which has never happened before. Also would like to note that a-lot of people are leaving due to the fact u get banned for an emoji? Tell me why celebrities or bigger people can post drugs or scams clear as day but the moment someone else posts a mushroom emoji suddenly it’s bad. yall should give an option to migrate the old memory’s as well it’s pretty messed up y’all can take years of memories like that over something trivial as an emoji. I understand needing to be stricter but i see people posting harder drugs and they still have their account. But the moment someone posts even a spec of marijuana their account vanishes like that. It makes no sense whats gonna happen when it’s legalized almost everywhere?? Why don’t celebrities get the same treatment?? Why do i see scam ads like those fake car and money giveaways??? It’s so backwards y’all make no sense I can post a link to a scam website but if i get a med card and post me hitting a joint I’m gone. Crazy
"I was using Snapchat more than any other app when it was in its prime. It was the best! It became big when I was in high school. Once they drastically updated a few years ago pretty much everyone I know stopped using it and couldn’t stand it. The discover page is stupid and the app is way too over the top now. Nobody goes on Snapchat for news, and I don’t want to see all these people I’m not subscribed to ten times larger than the people I actually subscribe to or follow. Too much unnecessary stuff. Discover page killed the app. It was best when it was simple but it’s clear it became all about money for Snapchat. Disappointing, they truly destroyed themselves. Nobody I know really uses the app anymore, even the celebrities I like stopped using it. I went from using it more than any other app to not even opening it for weeks. It’s just not what it used to be. The end of an era. But I will say, the Snapchat camera in iOS still reigns as my favorite and is missed. It would take them going back to the old format and getting rid of discover to be good again but they’d lose money so that’ll never happen, although the way it’s looking I don’t think Snapchat will exist in a few years."
"Hi Snapchat . I’ve had Snapchat for many years and I love the app. Recently about a month ago I reposted a link to an only fans which was not mine and someone else’s cause they asked. I didn’t know much about only fans and that it was illegal. So my account got deleted. I was super mad because I had a lot of memories since 2016, that I didn’t have saved my phone. I made a mistake and I’m deeply sorry. I made another one and they locked my account last night saying that I had third party apps which I don’t. And that I was sending unsolicited snaps. I never posted anything inappropriate that my friends didn’t like. I did have ppl that I didn’t know so someone maybe reported me. I just deleted the app because it’s not worth getting into big trouble over some mistakes. I think we’ve all done stupid things like posting inappropriate but funny memes on Snapchat, and if that’s bad then that’s ridiculous. I’ll miss Snapchat but I’m hoping this will be for the best ."
"Snapchat is great. It’s really one of the best social media platforms around. However, this app loses a star for the terrible bugs and glitches that every user experiences on a daily basis and the ridiculous amount of battery drain it causes. I’m using an iPhone 12 Pro and am still noticing that the app drains battery at a ludicrous speed. This is expected, but still, I have to wonder if they could work on this at least a bit. This app is also really buggy. I have to restart it multiple times a day because it simply will not function. Whether it’s getting stuck on the camera tab or in my memories, the app is constantly being restarted. Also, I feel as though the developers have stopped listening to criticism. Many people hate the new redesign, but they kept it anyway. The whole community is asking for a night mode feature, but they have yet to even announce if they’ll work on one yet. Overall, the app is still great for its intended purposes, but frustrating and lackluster at times."
"okay so tonight we went to this sushi place and my little sister was playing with the wasabi with her chop sticks and i said it looked like we and we all started laughing i decided to post a picture of it joking about how it looks like weed. but apparently snapchat is stupid and didn’t notify me or anyone else that i have asked about the update about not showing, selling, or doing drugs/smoking. which is stupid and is making you lose people on the app bc of locking accounts and banning them from making a new one. well after that i was trying to make a new snapchat account and after making it it let me in for like 10 second then taking me back into y the login screen and saying “you’re accout has been permanently locked” I HAD JUST MADE THE ACCOUNT ! IT DOESNT LET ME USE MY PHONE NUMBER OR EMAIL TO MAKE A NEW ACCOUNT. this has happened before but my account got hacked and i couldn’t make a new one. snapchat is so stupid if they think that wasabi is the same thing as weed. i just want my account back. there’s so many memories and all my online friends and friends in general. taking my account away is taking away one of the reasons i’m alive right now.  if i didn’t meet those people i wouldn’t be here right now."
Snapchat has been great and all but with all these new spotlight videos and new updates it is RUINED Snapchat has been really slow and also brings back old filters no one want to use the doggy filter in 2021 everyone uses alt filter or something else all my filters will be added as favorite and every time there’s a new update they delete and don’t exist anymore like wth Snapchat and also they do nothing about their reports I have had multiple random people send me N0de$ of themselves and other people and me reporting them and blocking them doesn’t make a difference to Snapchat and they still don’t ban that persons account I’m not body shaming people and insulting people who send pictures of their body but please don’t their are a lot of kids who fake their ages and a lot of creepy old people too so please meet them in person before you start sending pictures and make sure you are not forced and don’t send even if they know you and also Snapchat look at your reviews and maybe you’ll get 5 stars on you app because no one uses you because of how different it’s changed
"I used to love this app but now is a different story. I would check my phone when I got a Snapchat notification from one of my friends. I would click on the notification and there would be no snap there. This has been happening for the past two weeks now. Today I got in and I started to snap my friends. My snaps wouldn’t go through but my messages would?? I tried turning off my WiFi and that didn’t work, then I turned it back on and turned off my cellular data and that didn’t work. I was not the only one that this happened to. I asked on my story if this was happening and it went through. This has happened to over 10 of my friends for the past few days. Snapchat has been glitching so much and messing up snaps. I used to love this app, but since the outline of the app changed— so did the quality on a lot of it.

Update: 
I deleted the app and reinstalled it to try to fix the problem. I reinstalled the app and it won’t let me in unless I verify with a phone number that I don’t use anymore or an email that I don’t use anymore 😡😡😡😡😡😡"
"i love it, i use it everyday. it’s actually my most used app. i’m able to keep in touch with my friends and i’ve even made a couple of new ones from it! the filters are cute, especially the filters from the recent update, such as “butterfly blush” and all kinds of cute filters made by everyday people. one suggestion i have as a new feature is, when it comes to the different filters, could you maybe try investing in a “favorites” where people could keep all their favorite filters? i know there’s subscriptions, so you can subscribe to someone and get access to all the filters they’ve made and keep up with them, but sadly you can’t subscribe to everyone! i was just thinking the favorites feature would be really helpful and it be a big hit with people who like to use the same filter. i love to use the “butterfly blush” and the “cloud blush” filter, but it’s hard to keep up with the exact one i want because there is so many of them and i love to use the exact one! plus, it can be hard to remember the exact name and if you don’t remember the exact name, it won’t usually show up. i also like to use certain filters when i take selfies, send streaks, or just post scenery photos on my story, but i can never keep up with the exact filter that i like to us or the other multiple other filters that i also prefer! i certainly have a list of filters i like to use in my notes, but i thought the “favorites” would be a clever feature! love your app though!"
"Snapchat is an amazing app. I love how it’s set up and everything. It is probably one of my favorite apps. I don’t know why people are always complaining about filters not being your favorite, but the whole fun of it is to scroll through them and find the ones that are funny and the always have new ones. So if you’re complaining about that, don’t be stupid please. And, for following, on spotlight, the fun of it is to scroll through to see all the videos, not just one. It defeats the purpose of that. I think that snapchat is a good app because it helps you find people that you haven’t chatted with much, and don’t know them that well yo have their phone number. So I think Snapchat is really good to find people you might know. Like for example, I was able to connect with all my friends on there and we were like “Thank god there is a Snapchat.” So I really appreciate Snapchat. It’s one of my favorite apps. Y’all who are downing, y’all gotta step up your game."
"This is why I hate Snapchat. I’ve had my account for 5 years never went against anything. I was getting sexually harassed by someone who kept making account and somehow texting me off them even tho I never added them, I sent multiple emails for days asking them to help they never responded. He now has hacked my account and got it permanently locked and I’ve contacted Snapchat multiple times to help and they haven’t at all. They contacted me saying I went against community guidelines when I didn’t someone hacked me and they won’t help me. If I were you I wouldn’t even bother with snap it’s a waste of time and the company is just there getting money while people contact them with problems and never respond back nor ever try to help you. Not to mention they don’t have a help line number, so they make it almost impossible to try and contact them. It’s not worth giving them money for you making an account when they won’t bother to help people who have used the app for literal years blows my mind how you want your app to be successful but you don’t even wanna help the people who use it everyday to contact people who don’t have numbers or Snapchat is the only thing they have."
"I love Snapchat! I’ve used it ever since 2020 (ik that’s not long) and I would greatly put a 5 star rating, but there’s some flaws and requests that I wanted to clarify. First off, I don’t like the notifications it gives you on chat when you screen record, take a screenshot, save a photo, etc. I just don’t understand why people would need to know that? And why we needed to let the person know we did it? And I also wish that they had more character positions for the locations. They already have great ones but I wish they had more options. But what really doesn’t make sense is the screenshot and screen record nonsense. I guess just in case if someone was “talking behind their back” they would need to know but everytime I take a screen shot of my friends friendship profile, and take a screen shot of someone’s chat by accident, they freak out and then get all upset because they think I’m doing something. Please consider thinking about updating your app :) But I would definitely recommend this app."
"OMG, like this app is amazing!! I use Snapchat almost every day and I send tons of snaps with my friends! We text and snap back and forth. I’ve had this app for maybe 3 years or so.... anyways, but I absolutely enjoy it! I love talking to my friends especially during the pandemic and I love snapping too. I love the awesome features. In my opinion, I hope more features will come soon in the future. The only thing is when you’re snapping and after if you want to write a caption, you don’t get that many characters. In my opinion, I don’t meant to hurt anybody’s feelings but it’s a little irritating. Snapchat is all about having fun, connecting with your friends and expressing who you are. I can say confidently that me and all of my friends even my cousins spend just about all our time on Snapchat. It has brought many people I know together in ways I’ve never seen by another app. So far, Snapchat is one of my favorite and recently used apps. I think that it’s really cool to share photos with your friends, so you can show them what an awesome time you were having or if the photo is a special moment between the two of you!;) I also love that you can play many different games and use many different Bitmojis. The only thing that worries me is, when you make your Bitmoji what if hackers find out your identity? Maybe, I’m overreacting but it could still happen. 

Please don’t forget to read and have a great day;)💜❤️❤️💜

Love💛, 

Lexi💜💛"
"The new way saving stories to memories isn’t always working when there’s more than a few snaps. Before the button once pressed would show the status with a circle showing how much has been uploaded until it’s done but now when it actually works it pops up on the top of the screen on a bar,  it if you don’t manually wait and go back to check a lot of times it doesn’t finish saving and then after the 24 hours they are gone. There needs to be a better status showing when or if it’s working. 
Also, in Our Story Snaps, some snaps save and other dont ie 2 weeks who snaps show up and then ones within the past 3 days are no where to be found.

I like to save everyone I post into one story for each day and there’s no easy way to do it. There should be a way to set a time of time to be automatically saved in one story together like 9am to 5pm or 11am to 9pm or maybe if one story ends and then a large group of snaps are posted before that first snap is to expire there needs to be a way to get a notification from SC itself that ask if you want to save the latest set of post to a story before they disappear from existence"
I enjoy the concept of this app. It gets the job done for what it is. I have some issues though because I use this app daily. The call button should not be next to the back to other friends page. I have accidentally called people so many times when I wanted to snap other friends. Now I have to go to my profile to tap the image I just posted on my story feed. Filters are not sorted well. My friend cannot use the same filter as me unless I use it first. To find a filter specifically produced by snapchat is difficult. A filter for the multiple people (and dogs) should be a category. I'm still not sure why there is a notification sound when someone is typing it is confusing especially when you are snapping to multiple people. Not sure how people keep adding me as friends when I have quick add off and friends only contact me. There should be a button to save the snap you just sent to someone in chat. A friend is the only one who can save it at the moment.
"I have been permanently logged out of Snapchat for no reason at all. However, the way it happened was unreasonable and outrageous. I have reached out to Snapchat multiple times and they haven’t done anything. My story was reported multiple times by the same person, my ex boyfriend, because of old history. Because of that, I have lost my account and have no way of getting back in despite other accounts I’ve tried to made. This is the last time I’m going to be reaching out because after this review there’s no point if Snapchat doesn’t fix the problem. I won’t be downloading the app again or using it due to this problem and have discussed it with my mom who also thinks this is outrageous and complete nonsense. She has tried to reach out as well and I still has seen no change whatsoever. This has happened to more people than just me. But if the problem isn’t fixed within the next 48 hours I will be contacting the company whom influences Snapchat and will not hold back. Get back with me as soon as possible and please take time reading this to better understand my point of view and how I’m feeling about this situation. 
      Thank you, Delilah."
"Snapchat was my favorite social media app but now I am very upset with the app. A few days ago snapchat deleted my account for no reason and I lost all of my memories. I had no clue what was wrong because it was something so random. I can no longer access my account and I am super upset. Before anyone thinks anything, I do not use this app in an inappropriate way nor show abusive behavior. At first I thought they deleted my account because i had too many people added or i had that account for too long but that was certainly not the case. I’ve already tried making new accounts but they delete in the first couple of minutes. A few days after my account deleted I tried making a new one and it finally worked. Until later in the day it had signed me out and told me that my account was locked. I had to unlock my account at least 3 times and afterwards locked my account permanently. I don’t understand why it doesn’t let me log in anymore. So, now I do have to delete the app which is very upsetting because I’ve had it for 5 years now. I already warned many people about this app so please be careful!"
"I made an account in 2014, same  year as the app launch. I just switched to a different carrier, and because the account was associated with a recycled phone # I switched to, the first time I signed in again it banned me for good. I did nothing wrong. I broke no rules. But maybe because my device was associated with a ""guilty"" phone # I was unfortunate enough to receive I am now permanently barred from using this app. I had years of photos and memories I can never get back in there. Special memories and events that snapchat now owns in their cloud, and according to their terms & conditions they may use at their whim for any 3rd party advertisements or internet leakage at their peril. If you take a picture or a video using their service, they own it. It isn't yours anymore. They're marketing this towards kids now too, with all the filters. This was a SEX APP. Literally. It was for teens to send nudes to eachother on and then they'd self destruct in 10 seconds. Now theres little kids on this app and they're spoon-feeding them propaganda with their biased media like ""gender reveals"" and pro-communist perspectives. This is a sad tool to control our youth and I regret every second of the many 7 years I spent on it."
"Developers, the discover platform is out of control. It’s a obnoxious, instructive, and ruining your app. Many stories contain explicit content, are inappropriate, distasteful and worst of all, impossible to remove. Several times I have used the “hide/report” features for particular discover stories that I do not want to have pop up on my screen, only to find the same story appear a couple   days later (sometime even right after I report/hide) or a discover story almost identical appear. The “hide” feature is a sad excuse, at your attempt to give people the ability to control content. Please, think about a way to allow users to turn the discover feature off, or seriously curtail and modify the content. Otherwise, this user as I sure as many others, will stop using the app and remove it.  This use to be a good feature back when it was first developed, but now I am afraid to use Snapchat around others. I never know what will pop up, often the content is inappropriate, and it never stops so matter how many times I hide or report stories. There will always be another one the next day to further drive me away from the app."
"Snapchat used to be my go to app to communicate with friends, watch their stories, look at different articles. The amount of ads that it has now, especially the ones you are forced to waste time sitting through, is disgusting. It has turned me off from wanting to use the app at all most times and pushed me towards other apps such as tiktok where i can just scroll past the ads if i am not interested in it, or watch it if i would like to. If i find myself on the app, well over 90% of the time i exit the app due to the outrageous amount of time i have to waste on repeated ads. The left sided politics are the only political views that are shown. If you are going to put one side out there, at least put out the other as well. All information found on snapchat is extremely biased. I do enjoy that i can communicate with friends over pictures, call them on here, post my stories, save memories & view daily memories as well, & that there is a section on snapchat about beauty/sports/news etc. Just wish that it was a neutral section instead of a heavy set opinionated section. In my opinion, the creators of the app are downgrading it instead of upgrading."
"Last night on October 20th, I just left a concert having saved a bunch of pictures and videos with friends. By the time I got home, my account was logged out for some reason. I tried logging in when Snapchat gave me a prompt saying “Unidentified credentials.” I tried changing the password and it said the same thing. Once I looked into it I found out so many people have been having the same problem with their accounts being deleted or locked through most of 2021. I AM SO MAD AND UPSET. All my memories are deleted and gone, and all my friends. GONE. I have a few of their contacts elsewhere but not everyone and this is very upsetting. I don’t know what “violations of terms and services” I was in violation of but they gave me no warning. Just that my account is up and gone just like that. And it’s upsetting that Snapchat has the ability to BAN YOUR DEVICE entirely. That’s too much control especially for an app you have to download first to use. And No customer service either, just automated bots telling me the same thing over and over. 
Snapchat, you need to fix this, and you owe me a new account since my original one I’ve had for about 4-5 years is now gone. 😡😡"
"Usually I love Snapchat and I use it multiple times a day, but not anymore 🤬. The new update is horrible! It’s so ugly like the black line doesn’t go with anything and it doesn’t look good at all. And now when we take pictures instead of having that iPhone XR,x,11,12 shape its square like the old iPhones and I hate it. It looks so ugly and ruins pictures. And is it just me or did the camera quality get worse?! They look so bad now. And not to mention I CANT HALF SWIPE INTO CHATS ANYMORE. When I don’t want to open a message, I should be able to half swipe it like I used to. And also when I open chats I swipe into them I should not have to click them. Overall the update is horrible and isn’t good at all. I hate it and so do my friends. Snapchat please please please let us go back to the old app. We don’t like the update at all and it wasn’t a good idea. We need half swiping! 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡😡😡😡."
"Snapchat was really good at first. It allowed me to connect with family across the globe. It allowed me to get homework help from classmates who’s numbers I don’t have. It allowed me to share memories with others. But in the last two months Snapchat has had so many glitches. It sends me “ghost” notifications that someone snapped me but when I look at my Snapchat no one snapped me. Or I try and send something and it won’t allow me to. It will always say unable to connect but I’m on a very strong WiFi. When I use my data it say the same thing and my data is equally as strong. The worst part is that it’s not just me who’s going through this. Many of my friends aren’t even able to log out of their Snapchat. The app tells them “unable to log out” so if I can’t log out and I also can’t log in what’s the use of the app. Especially in times where we need apps like Snapchat to connect and talk to our friends, what’s the point if we can’t even use it properly. It says that they updated the app on April 6th but it’s already has a new round of bugs that aren’t helping users. Snapchat has had more bugs in their app the last two months than instagram has had in a year. Fix it."
"I don’t know why I ever downloaded it in the first place, but since I only use it on occasion, I don’t think on it that often. At the beginning, I did all of the setup routines by choosing my interests and subscriptions, which includes mostly cooking and animals. It didn’t take long for me to realize how much I hated the program. First, no matter what you choose to subscribe to, the foul Kardashian/Jenner clan will always pop up. I can’t go a day without hearing about the one who redid her whole face just so she could look like her siblings. It’s amazing how a few basic girls can fool a nation into thinking they are hot, innovative, and genuine! Second, the stories that do seem somewhat interesting must have been written by a high school dropout. I teach English, and one of the common topics that I discuss with students is brevity and getting to the point. Someone needs to review that with the crap writers on here. Lastly, the program itself bugs out constantly. I am usually in the middle of an article when it just ends. The only way to get back to it is to scroll through the crap that you already read. 

Listen, it’s just not worth the hassle. You’ll be better off downloading a news source or, pretty much, anything that isn’t Snapchat."
"I’ve had Snapchat for years and the strides you’ve made to make it even better every update is awesome. It took me a while to get used to this new one, but there are some minor bugs I notice. When I’m watching a story I’m subscribed to, it won’t let me tap back to the previous slide. It’s almost as if it gets stuck and I have to tap it 10 times for it to become unstuck. I also notice that every time I exit out of a story or accidentally swipe to the next story it starts from the beginning. Other than that it’s been okay. However I think there should be a list of the stories you’ve been watching on the discover page because stories oftentimes disappear in the tremendously large page (if not already. I don’t go on the last page much). Also, the map was in a much better place before as you had to swipe down. People would rather swipe on their messages than be taken to the map which is rarely used. The last few are just some food for thought, but I love the app and I want to see it reach its full potential"
"My account has been deleted over a week now. I have reached out to support every single day. I have filled out over 50 help request surveys just to get the same email with a different name so it LOOKS like someone actually cares. I lost everything from the past 5 years because they decided to ban me without an explanation. Without even a warning. I didn’t violate a single term of the app because I have also went through that about 6 times now just to make sure I didn’t. They don’t care about you or your feelings even though there wouldn’t even be a Snapchat without us users. This is ridiculous and sad because I have very sentimental photos in there that I will never be able to have again for a reason I do not know for the fact not one person since my account was banned has reached out to me even after every survey and request I have filled out. They do not care about their users at all so to avoid dealing with something like losing all of your stuff and not being able to recover it or even make a new account to start fresh, id recommend not using the app. If I could give 0 stars I would because this is actually ridiculous."
"I have used snap since 2013 and never had any major issues with it. Tonight they randomly terminated my account, meaning I also am banned from making another. They deleted all of my memories: baby pictures, my dog that’s no longer alive, pictures of my cat as a kitten, concerts, and friends and family. Memories I will never get to relive are just gone in a blink of an eye. I’m guessing I broke a guideline somehow or they terminated me just because an ex reported me for posting pictures with my now boyfriend. They gave me zero warning or clarification of what I even did wrong, they didn’t explain in the email. I’ve struggled to try and find an email or phone number and found nothing to actually contact them. I reached out on Twitter and they just told me they couldn’t help through Twitter and to look at their terms and services. The worst support from an app ever and they are the least understanding service if they seriously just terminate accounts that have been open for 7 years with no warning or way of getting memories. If I could give negative stars I would. I used to love snap but I hate them for deleting 7 years of my life off the app and then not even willing to help!!"
"Hi Snapchat! This is an amazing app, and awesome for texting your friends. I’ve had this app for years now. But I feel like you should consider adding a few new things. First off I would like to consider being able to pin more than 3 people, I just feel like sometimes it’s hard to pick who you want to have at the top when there’s only a small number opinion. Second off I think being able to customize/ make your own bestfriend list would be really cool and helpful. I think this would be helpful  because if you end up not texting someone anymore and they are far along in your list it’s hard to get them off. I just think it would be a very useful feature to be added! Last but not lease I think considering a dark, or black mode to Snapchat would be really cool! Once again this is an amazing app already and very fun to use but I would just like to to consider adding these features.

Thank you for considering!"
"So all platforms have ads and it is just seeming to be part of our everyday life. You can usually turn them down or do something else during those ads to make it easier to get through, but that is not my issue here with Snapchat. My issue with Snapchat is that you cannot do anything on the platform without an ad popping up especially when you are trying to watch their short videos. As well as when you try to watch any short video they pop up CONSTANTLY to the point that it cuts out the video so much you cannot enjoy what you are watching, and they don’t properly time some of these ads so that when the ad stops you are at the same point in your video and you end up missing what was said or shown. I for this reason will be not watching the small videos anymore and just using another platform because I knows of think it’s just disrespectful at this point. Ads are fine but when we can tell you’re being deliberately greedy it just makes me not want to use you platform. When my streak gets lost inevitably at some point I will be deleting the app."
"I woke up to my app being terminated this morning, i think someone was using my phone to make video & im not sure how the video got uploaded or why it was uploaded in the first place, ive have been loyal to this app for more then 5 years & never once had my account disabled , terminated, locked nothing of that matter & for the first time ever my account got hacked and instead of informing me if what was posted or why it was inappropriate they DELETED EVERYTHING all of those years, memories , moments that were captured in this app just gone with out no question, i guess this is what happens when u run a billion dollar company off our people , they care about the coins & whats terminating one person account going to do to them especially with no action behind or proof this was an intentional post . Im sad i am heartbroken ive never experienced this with any social media account. Snapchat always has been great but there comes a tike when every social media platfrom hits rock bottom like myspace and i have over 20k followers on instagram maybe it is time to seek out the bad i. This company and the lack emapthy towards your loyal users shame on u snapchat & i hope your platfrom ends one day"
"Always used Snapchat and love the concept of the app but the facts that it seems to tweak and not allow me to edit video lengths anymore, seems to not want to send anything even when I have good service. Just little stupid problems constantly that didn’t use to happen it enough to almost make anyone just want to delete the app. Not to mention these probs Snapchat has also ruined the way story’s can be viewed etc not the same app it used to be and it said because this has been my most used social media and still continues to be only because of the others that still use it. Snapchat also seems to want to ban and or give warnings or bans to accounts that have done nothing wrong when there’s ton of spam accounts, porn account, account selling drugs etc that just get away with it and people like me and other seems to get our accounts messed with like we have done thing wrong. Please explain how that makes since? Very disappointed w the company. FIXX UR APP SNAPCHAT AND BRING BACK THE WAY THINGS USED TO WORK PLEASE NOBODY LIKES THIS NEW SETUP. STOP BANNING PEOPLE DOING NOTHING WRONG AND OR HAVE BEEN REPORTED BY SOMEONE WITH NO FUTURE LOOKING INTO ANYTHING, SEEMS WHOEVER REPORTS WHO FIRST IS THE ONE WHO LOOSES THE ACCOUNT??? WORRY ABOUT THE ILLEGAL ACCOUNTS ETC."
"Snapchat is a great app to talk to your friends and family. :) I love being able to see all my saved memories, even from past years. One problem I have is that when I go into my “My Eyes Only”, and I input the correct password (I know it is correct for a fact because I put in each number slowly so as not to be locked out), snapchat proceeds to lock me out. I continue to put in that same passcode because as I said, I know it is the passcode I have used for the past 3 years and I put in each number carefully. Snapchat, I don’t know what the issue is, but I would like to enter my “My Eyes Only” with my password. I did login to my account on a separate device, so maybe that had something to do with Snapchat locking me out of my “My Eyes Only” despite inputting the correct password. But that should still be no excuse to it be able to enter my “My Eyes Only” and be locked out for hours despite inputting the correct password. I have important memories saved, and I would like to never worry that they will be lost forever. Thank you."
"everytime one of my friends send me a snap and i click on it, it doesn’t open. i have full bars of wifi and data. it says “Tap to load” and then once i click “Loading” but it never opens. this goes for snaps and videos they send. i logged out of my snap and logged back in, and the same thing happened. i deleted the app and then downloaded it again and the same things keep happening. i have space on my iphone. i cleared my cache. nothing is working and i don’t know what to do. i’ve had the same snapchat for almost 4 years and nothing this bad has ever happened. i don’t know what’s wrong with it. i tried the help center and nothing is coming up for my problem. and also when i click on one of my friends stories, it takes me to somebody else’s and i can’t see my friends. it then says i already viewed their story and nothing comes up when i click on their profile. has this happened to anybody else before? can somebody please help me i have no idea what’s going on. is it an update? is it my phone? nothing has happened with any of my friends. is it just me? i have no clue."
"So I love Snapchat and I use it all the time everyday. However it is getting somewhat boring and not that fun anymore. However, I love when Easter comes around and we get to collect the eggs all around and see who can get the most. It is always something fun I look forward to do with my best friend and it’s not exactly the same his year but it’s the best it can. So basically I wanted to suggest doing something like this but all the time so basically I think it would be cool to get like badges or award or something to collect when you go to a new place, state, country, or a state park or significant place like Washington monument or mt Rushmore or something. I don’t know I just think adding that would be a cool feature and so you could compare with your friends. And you could see where your friends have traveled too and what badges they have on the snap maps. I think this would spice it up a little and just add to the overall fun usage of the app. Thanks"
"Snapchat in my opinion is a very good app for communicating and memories. I personally love it because I can talk to all of my friends and family through this app. A few of the reviews say that since the update there has been a few bugs but ever since I have had it which has been years I haven’t had a problem. Every update it just the app just gets better and better. I also like this app because if you run out of storage on your phone you can save the images and always have them as memories. If you have younger siblings and don’t have a way to communicate through the phone this app is here to help. You can create your own filters, save images, call, text, and a lot more... if you want the opportunity to make nice new friends then this is the app for you. DISCLAMER if you use a birthday date under the age of 13 then you will not be able to create an account. You also have an avatar and you can edit it to your liking. I hope you guys enjoy the app.👩🏽‍💻"
"I use Snapchat every single day guaranteed and it’s basically the only app I use. I give it a 5/5 for its excellent work of providing us with stories, a camera, and a section to chat in. Although,  today, I have been having a problem with my story. I go to post something and it says it’s sent to my story. When I go to check my story, Snapchat says that the post had failed to send. As soon as noticing this early in the morning, I tried reseting my phone, deleting then reinstalling the app, and even restarting my WiFi. Yet, non of these helped me find the solution. In the afternoon, I went to a friends house and even connected to her wifi, my snaps still wouldn’t upload! At one point I tried saving the snap I wanted on my story and then posting it from my camera roll. Still no luck! 
I hope I’m not the only one having this problem but either way I would really appreciate it if you guys could fix this glitch. Other than that, thank you and keep up the good work :)"
"This app has an array of glitches. I haven’t encountered many of them but the one that plages me is it not delivering snaps from me to other people. It’ll read delivered on my end but my friends will have never even seen a notification for it. Snap are disappearing and it leaves the sender to only wonder if the receiver is ignoring them, when on the other end they are shown left on read. Me and my ex best friend where on some rocky roads and this glitch was the last straw. Trying to work out our problems where hindered by this glitch and now things have gotten so bad that she didn’t even consider me a friend. Because friends wouldn’t leave them on read on never text them right. Well I did... or at least I tried but it never got to her. But she doesn’t believe me and my best friend of 5 years has drifted out of my life. The little things like sending your friend a hey every once in a while or a video showing a dumb thing happening right then is of huge importance to show how often you think of them,  take these away and you can destroy an already crumbling friendship... but do them and fix it. I tried but Snapchat ruined it for me and she’s out of my reach now. Thanks a lot and please fix this glitch"
"The other day I go on Snapchat to respond to my friends and then I went to add someone and a minute later I received an email/was temporarily locked from my account. I have tried to contact Snapchat, but all I get is bot messages with the same response. I have a page that a link took me to once I re-verified my account through the link I was given and if took me to a page where I can manually Unlock but when I go to it states “can’t process request at this time”. They have nobody to communicate with and it’s really a bother. I don’t want to make a new Snapchat because then I lose all of the memories I have saved and all the friends on there. I would have to go through the trouble of adding everyone and posting about how I have a new snap which I really don’t want to do. If there is anyway the Devs can see this and try and fix this glitch to where you can’t unlock the account. I don’t use any third party apps or spam or anything like that. I’m not a bot account and am one of the legitimate accounts that their automated system mistakenly accused of a “spam” account. Please help."
"90% of subscription stories are the epitome of click bait garbage clearly added as a way to shove more ads down the users’ throats. God help you if you want to actually read any of the the linked articles within subscription stories. I have yet to encounter one that doesn’t feature buggy, paginated sites with ads between every 150 words. Oh wait, what’s that? You actually made it to the end of the article wading through ad after ad to get the last page to see what the title is mentioning? And.... It’s more click bait! But seriously, the quality of some of the stuff on discover is just atrocious and the click bait level is off the charts. Obviously you can just ignore discover all together, but the concept is pretty cool, and there’s a lot of potential there. It’s just a real shame that it’s filled with nonsense.

That said, I have used Snapchat since it came out, and I really do like the mode of communication it provides for my friends and me. However, if there ever comes a time when another app is comparable to its ease of use in this category, I won’t stick around."
"I usually don’t write reviews but I do want to say first & foremost that I love this app. I really do...but its’ come w/ a few bugs before, that have now been fixed. As of right now, the bug or problem I have is that sometimes when I’m taking a video, it records perfectly fine & then glitches for a second & comes back to normal right after. Its rlly wierd & I know other iPhone users have experienced this because I’ve seen people’s stories & I can tell that there is a glitch happening on the video(s) they post(ed). My sister also told me she has the same problem. It’s really annoying & I wish for it to be fixed because it happens very often now:/ At first it only happened once every 2 weeks but now it happens every other day:( I will give it full stars if this is fixed. It’s all I ask for! thank you snap! Ps. I had a little suggestion that maybe you guys can add a “archive” section for when someone accidentally deletes a snap & wants it back we can do that🤷‍♀️"
"I love the app, it’s good for communicating with fiends, weather it be through a chat or a snap with funny filters or a group chat! The group chats are amazing, no doubt about it, it’s helpful and it’s got a lot of interactivity, but one thing that could be helpful for a lot of people, is the option to mute a group chat without having to get on the app or on settings. What I mean with this is that sometimes people are busy on their phones or have something important and can’t get off what they’re doing to mute a group chat or go to settings. So....if you could implement an option where we could slide down on the notification of a group chat and mute it without having to get off what we’re doing at the moment, and whenever we get on the app to check the messages, the option of muting could disable automatically, or just have the option to mute it for a certain amount of time, but over all, the app is good, I love it and it’s fun! 😊🙂"
"I’m not going to stop reaching out for help! Because this is unfair you guys locked my account for “Spam Adding” when I wasn’t spam adding anyone, my abusive ex had my phone and kept tampering with my account and I didn’t even know it. This is unfair and you guys say you can’t recover a deleted account but that’s a lie because you guys did it before when you “Terminated”  for a misunderstanding. So I know you guys can unlock my account now. Because this was not my doing, I have YEARS WORTH OF MEMORIES. I lost my oldest sister in 2020 and I have ALL OUR PICTURES IN MY EYES ONLY ON THAT ACCOUNT. If I lose all of my deepest memories with my older sister that died I’d just wanna kill myself at this point because it’s not fair that you guys lock my account and say that my account was spam adding and it was a verified number and email on there when MY EMAIL AND NUMBER ARE BOTH VERIFIED ON MY ACCOUNT. Please give me my account back, if it gets to the point to where I have to bring this to court I will because I value my memories especially with people who I loved so deeply who have been tragically taken from me I will stop at nothing to get my story out there if I don’t get my account back it’s not right."
"So, A couple of days ago I thought that I would not download snap. but one of my friends. Said that more people are starting to communicate on snapchat than on normal text messages. Lol, So I thought well maybe I’ll just download it and see how it goes. And I did and my friends were right snapchat is awesome! You can communicate with more people. Like friends and family if you both have the app And If you don’t have snap well that’s sad. Because people and friends are going to start asking for your snap instead of your number now days. The only thing is that do you have to be careful what you click on I accident clicked twice on one of my friends story mode which you will fine out later when you download this app. And accidentally sent this weird cheesy emoji to one of my cousins it was so embarrassing. 😰 luckily I was able to delete it. But be careful about that. And most importantly have fun on ✨Snapchat!!✨
 🎉🤩🥳😆😄"
I’ve used snap for well over 5 years and randomly had my account deleted and then locked out of an old backup account and I lost 5+ years of photos and the (probably thousands) of photos that I had from my ENTIRE time in high school. I’m the end I realized I shouldn’t of relied on this app but I never thought my account would be deleted…and the only thing I didn’t do was keep up with their like constant 2 week reverification and all they do it put you in contact with bots (somewhat understandable but extremely frustrating and unhelpful) I was a very active user and used to absolutely love this app and my account literally randomly get deleted was the last thing I ever thought was going to happen. They are also very unhelpful with telling you why your account got deleted leaving the user themselves to try and figure out what it is and are very unapologetic and finish off their (already unhelpful emails) with simply “we are unable to assist you further with this issue” after telling me that my account was apparently terminated and I’m prohibited from making any new accounts (remember this is for not doing their continuous reverification)
"I got my entire account deleted that I’ve had for about a decade, I cant even make a new one, lost years of memories and pictures. Thing is all I did was make a joke about tic tacs. And with no warning my whole account along with all my contacts that I’ve built up for years are gone. It seems like an algorithm of some kind just booted me off and they lazily had no one monitor the issue so I lost everything over basically nothing. I’ve gone through multiple forums and this is an issue probably thousands of people are having. Thanks Snapchat you used to be a great app but now no one can speak freely without losing years of data with no warning, but a bunch of girls can post near-nude selfies promoting their only fans and get away with it. Makes sense to me🤷‍♂️ if this issue doesn’t get fixed soon I don’t think this app will be around much longer. Don’t lazily have robots decide what violates the terms! Or at the very least give us a temporary ban and tell us exactly what we did wrong so we have a chance to avoid violating the terms again. There has to be some law about deleting all that personal data without a way to recover years of memories.."
"I've been using snapchat since probs 2014, and i've always loved it. it turned into everyone's main source of communication in my town. however, some of the recon updates have been making me mad. when you swipe left it goes to the map unless you are holding someone's bitmoji while you swipe left which is kinda annoying but i've gotten used to it. also with the latest update, i can't swipe left IN a conversation to see what time i or someone else sent something. instead when i swipe left in a convo it does that stupid ""reply to specific message"" crap that almost no one actually uses. i have to start scrolling in the convo to see the time and then it disappears in less than a second. i look at the times messages were sent all the time and now i end up trying to figure it out for like 5 minutes. for those reasons i'm rating it 3 stars, would do 4 but they have made multiple updates that no one likes over the years, kind of aggravating going back and forth between great and annoying."
"First I will describe what happened to me.  My friend attempted to log into his account from my phone, it didn’t work because he typed in the wrong password.  I then attempted to log back into my account which then said i was temporarily banned.  I went to Snapchat’s website and clicked the unlock button just to learn it permanently blocked me.  I spent 3 weeks trying to contact Snapchat to no avail.  Everyday once a day(every 24 hours on the nose) i was able to log in for about 5 minutes which i used to save all my memories if i tried to send a snap it would log me out.  I got all my memories and i tried to make a new account.  It wouldn’t let me create a new account on my phone.  I tried multiple phone numbers, multiple emails and nothing worked.  I tried deleting the app and reinstalling it to no success.  They also do not provide adequate support to people experiencing issues.  I have not been able to speak with a real person and they have not responded to my service requests for either issue.  I didn’t violate terms of services and I have not done anything wrong.  I run a small business off of my account and i need to have it."
"I have had my snapchat since before 2016. In this time since then i’ve had a little girl in July of 2020, ALL my pregnancy pictures and memories as well as hospital pictures and newborn pictures are on this snapchat. I was RANDOMLY permanently locked out of my account for no reason at all. I do not use a 3rd party app. I do not spam my stories or other people with anything at all, and there is no suspicious activity on my account. I have tried at all costs to reach someone, anyone at snapchat support and it’s a complete fail. Snapchat customer service is the WORST i have EVER seen in my 23 years of living. There’s a link to recover legitimate accounts but when i click the unlock button it tells me my account is permanently locked. When i click the link to see why my account has been locked the link doesn’t even work. I have reached out to snapchat support on twitter as i see 100s of people doing and i’m getting the SAME exact response. Snapchat, this is absolutely ridiculous. If i can’t get ANY of my memories or a resolution to this issue and get me account back. i will have my whole customer base leave 1 star reviews and then we’ll watch the ratings plummet  down."
"Giving it 3/5 because I love the app overall and it rarely messes up, but today for whatever reason, it took away my streak with my friend that’s been extremely long. Keep in mind I send a streak every morning at 6:20am-6:40am and I never miss it because it’s always my coffee for work from Starbucks. Welp I woke up today at 4am for work and it was gone. Then I KNOW 1,000% that I sent a streak to my story, streak friend that I lost it with and my last other streak (sent it at 6:40am and I have it saved in memories), well I just got to lunch at 12:30pm only to find that just 6 hours later and I got the hourglass on my end (with a screenshot for proof) and nearly lost it, I sent a pic and it went away. Why should I bother with a streak if it fails to work the way it should? It happened once when I had one around 180 and sent an email and complaint, got a response from a Theresa saying they couldn’t do anything. As soon as I lose this last streak (which will probably be any given time since it can be gone hours later), I’m done with streaks. It messed up and they won’t help."
"For the past few days, I’ve been experiencing the annoyance of taking a picture on Snapchat and after about half a second, the picture automatically lightens. It makes me look pale and it lowers the quality of the pictures to look blurry. Also, videos are very glitchy, you can see literal squares and pixels on the screen! This has been happening to me and all of my friends. It is really affecting my enjoyment of Snapchat because I used to chat with my friends all the time, but now I don’t even care to go on because of the disappointing update. It also has a weird bar on the bottom and the snap map is on a page instead of being accessible by swiping down on the camera screen. The bar blocks part of the screen so I can’t see part of the pictures that I take or snaps that I receive. I’ve contacted Snapchat multiple times about the issues with this update in hopes that they would listen to their supporters and change things back to how it used to be, but I haven’t heard anything or seen any changes. I’m frankly disappointed because I love to talk with people on Snapchat but now I don’t even feel a desire to use this app."
"Hey there. I know this won’t be seen by a lot of people but i’m just ranting about my experience with this app. My main concern is that the mods and devs are completely elusive (more elusive than my dad). When someone’s account gets unjustly banned or locked no one is there to help them get it back. Also, in other situations when there is someone who is actually posting offensive content or spreading false information through the app, the mods never pay attention. With an app that has such a huge amount of users, mods need to be active all times of the day in every time zone. My second issue is not really that bad but, what is with the uneven updates. Давай люди! I have friends who are on the old snapchat and I have some who are on versions newer than me. I cant understand what is up. For the meantime, I am giving them the benefit of the doubt and saying it’s got to do with the servers. If you read this, that’s great. If you didn’t, oh well. Even though there are some issues with the app, it is still very good and worth the download, since it’s free. Also a good way to stay in contact with friends. 🫠"
"First of all, if you’re a teenager Snapchat is like, THE app to have. Seriously, all my friends have it and it’s the main way I communicate. There have been times when it’s glitchy but right now it’s not bad. They usually fix the bugs pretty fast :) 

Sadly, I don’t have dark mode? It’s not like I have an old phone, I have an iPhone XR. My friend with an 11 has it, so I’m just wondering why it’s not available for me yet. I’ll figure it out eventually. 

Anyways. Here are some suggestions I hope you’ll take into consideration! 

1. Customizing the filters / lenses that are available to you in your main lens bar. (For lack of a better term). Im really happy that you can now favorite filters so you can save them for later! However Snapchat is always giving me useless ones that I don’t need. I understand some are for advertising purposes, but I should be allowed to delete and add lenses to my bar. I don’t care about turning myself into a baby or making my face look silly. I use Snapchat to take cute pictures. So I think it just makes sense. 

2. Searching sounds. Come on. I really don’t understand why this isn’t an available feature. I don’t feel like scrolling through tons of sounds just to find the right one. I know it’s a relatively new feature, but having a search function would be nice. 

Those are the only two I can think of right now. But overall Snapchat is a fun app and I hope more features will be added in the future!"
I’m having an issue where my Snapchat will open for a few seconds then crash and exit me out of the app. I tried restarting my phone to deleting my history. Nothing! Another issue is I’m getting Snapchat’s from like weeks ago. They are just now popping up. My best friend from school kept leaving me on delivered at least I thought and asked him hey bro why haven’t you snapped me lately?  He said what? and proceeded to show me his phone and I saw it and it said I’ve been leaving him on delivered for 4 days but it says for me that I sent a snap back to him and he left me on delivered for 4 days. Cmon snap. I rely on this app to contact my friends throughout the day and keep up with everyone. To not have a app that I’ve been using for years starting to become unreliable is a bit annoying. You guys are great and I appreciate you but I feel like there’s more and more problems coming up that aren’t being fixed. Please reply to my review!
"I usually have someone trap them and remove them from the room...I'm about to do the same thing. I guess my snap updated and now it just keeps quitting on me in the middle of snapping, typing or filming, I am an avid snapper that's how I communicate with most of my friends and my family since I talk better then type, I’ve been dealing with this for two days. I've uninstalled and re downloaded a few times, restarted the phone, logged in and out, I even updated my iOS which I NEVER do unless my apps stop working properly... and all for not...is snap down? Or is this update SUPER flawed? I don’t know what bugs were fixed but I definitely have some now that I didn’t before, I’m about to switch all my lifestyle snapping to IG if I keep losing content like this, it’s extremely frustrating!! Ive been on snap close to 8 years and dealt with all the changes the developers have thrown at me from filters to snap cash and stories, I just want to see and communicate with my long (and short) distance friends and family, and post my content without these hang ups!!"
"If zero stars was an option, I would happily click it. I’ve had Snapchat since it came out and originally loved it so much. But this past year they decided they wanted to change policies and basically take your right away of freedom of speech. I went from having my Snapchat for over 7 years with no reports or problems to my account being hacked and completely blocked deleted. With no way to submit an appeal because their system automatically deletes your account no warning nothing. So i made another which lasted literally a year before today March 13th it happened again and now they added this amazing new bonus feature that COMPLETELY LOCKS YOU FROM EVER MAKING AN ACCOUNT OR LOGIN IN WITH THEM AGAIN. What really gets me is i lost every memory of deceased family and friends twice now with no chance of ever getting them back. But if its for an actual criminal investigation they can find your account. I hope you all have better luck but I absolutely am devastated from the lack of empathy from this company. How can i enjoy social media that was meant to express yourself if i u get censored, reported, and blocked? 
All i can say for Snapchat is do better."
"It’s 2022 and how long has Snapchat been out? Why is it the developers of this app still have not gone back in and done some recording to allow this app to be more accessible/compatible with voice over so individuals who are blind/visually impaired can enjoy this social media platform as well? Nothing should still be reading as tab, widget, or button, but instead the actual function of the button. The screen jumps around or glitches when swiping left and right to scroll up and down the screen… certain features should be made easier to get to/use if you’re using any kind of accessibility; you still have to hard press on anything you want to save/share to get the menu to pop up then you have to scroll around to find the options instead of just being able to scroll to what you want and swipe up and down to find the function you need/want. People who are blind/visually impaired would like to be included and the thought processes when abs like this are in the developing stages in instead of new features you have to add as a afterthought for someone with visual impairment complains about how inaccessible your product is"
"I was doing fine on snapchat til today. For some reason, the app crashed exactly an hour and a half ago for me. After trying to get it, by deleting it and trying to log back in, I kept getting multiple error messages that say they aren’t able to do this action or to check my connection, even though it is perfectly fine. Still trying to log back in to my account, I try to reset my password, but again, more error messages. Then, at this current moment, I try to reinstall the all again after deleting it for the 3rd time, to see if it would take my correct credentials. And now, it doesn’t even download. I tried to delete and reinstall a different app just to make sure that there was nothing in my end that was messed up, but nope, it’s just Snapchat. Even more so, I checked to see if there were any current updates, and guess what? There was. 22hrs ago. “Bug fixes.” Update after update, it was all to fix these bugs. So now, I have absolutely no idea how to log back in to my account since Snapchat won’t let me change my password, and all these error messages keep preventing me from logging in. So. yay :)"
This app was cool but then it turned to whatever when i noticed that some bad things were happing. Like when i try to record there are times where it freezes and i would have to close the app and especially when i have flash on. There’s times where the app closes by its self for no reason. When i’m about to text someone it closes a few times and i end up being able to see what they said. ALL OF MY MEMORIES DISAPPEARED from this month up to 4th of July!!! It was fine one night and literally the next morning they were gone and i didn’t even log out of snapchat or logged in from another device. I deleted a whole bunch of things from my phone to try and get them back but they never came back. If it was because i didn’t back them up then it wasn’t completely my fault that it takes forever to back them up with both my wifi and my cellular data. I find this dumb because it should back up automatically with no problems without me having to do it. I’m still hoping that there’s a way to get them back.
"I won’t lie when i say i truly do love snapchat. it’s the first thing i check when i wake up and the last when i go to bed and i’ve been using it for years now. it’s how i keep in contact with many people and share moments. With this being said I find that with every month that passes i’m running into more trouble with the app itself. It’s always changing and updating for the worse. Don’t get me wrong, i adore the new shortcut button and the addition of many filters and things but it’s slowing down the app. i’m finding an issue of not receiving snaps from someone, and then all of a sudden it’ll pop up from days ago. Also many times i have problems sending a snap to someone, for no reason the app will glitch out, not send or freeze completely. Sometimes it even shows all these numbers and letters when i tap on someone’s name to snap them back which leads to a completely frozen screen. Others seem to be having very similar issues. if these could be resolved this app would easily get a 5- star rating."
"As of the time I’m writing this review this is the fourth time I have been locked out of my snap for no reason. I’m starting to suspect that I’m being locked out since I’m out the country because I’m doing normal tasks such as adding people for views, posting a view snaps and I only text two people because this snap is new. I made it two or so days ago and have already been locked out four times. This is getting to a point where I am going to just uninstall the app because there’s no support email or contact so there’s nothing you can do but wait hours and hours for that stupid site to unlock your account, and then this automated system doesn’t even tell you why the hell its locking you out. For one you need a support email or contact, I cannot understand how such a huge app is lacking in this department. Two, you need to fix this automated system because if this is happening to me then it’s definitely happening to other people who are perhaps not writing reviews but just opting to delete the app. If a developer or person of that sort sees this by any chance please reach out to me because I just keep getting locked out."
"I use Snapchat all the time, a great way to talk to friends but recently Snapchat has been going down hill. Ever now and then Snapchat says it cants send a snap or some sort of connection error when my connection is great. 3 bars all the time so usually I logout and then login again  and it works. sometimes I delete the app and reinstall it and then it works but I just tried that now and it took almost an hour for Snapchat to let me back into my account because it kept telling me connection error or can’t connect when I have great service. It was really frustrating and I lost a new snaps bc of it and it’s okay it was my fault I didn’t back them up but it should t have taken me an hour to get back into my account. I will still continue to use Snapchat but please read this and try to fix whatever makes your app do this. Another suggestion maybe actually have a real customer support so when we have problems likes this we can actually talk to someone and get help rather then read articles you put together to get an idea of what’s going on  and how to fix something."
I had been locked out of my account and continuously able to unlock it after 12+hours and after a second of logging back in it locks again. Snap chat doesn’t want to tell you or talk to you to resolve these situations instead they ignore you for no reason at all. The creators of Snapchat are violating our rights to be free and to post what we want and only mess with very few out of the many things that violated their guidelines and it’s outrageous. If Snapchat is doing this to anyone else just know if they are locking your account to go through messages and pictures that is illegal and against our rights. We have the right to keep things private but Snapchat sees ever pictures and videos you take then turns around and uploads it to google. If you don’t believe me you can see for yourself. Snapchat has been violating rights since they made the app. They have a group of people who watch what we save even if not posted such as private pictures you may feel confident in or private messages that you and another person has been talking and they read it all. Snapchat is a great app but the TEAM SNAPCHAT Is unprofessional and they won’t email  back
"I honestly feel like everyone should delete and cancel Snapchat (even though the odds are slim) I’ve been locked out of my account for almost two months now. Every time I contact Support, they ignore everything I say and send some generic link and message on the reason why my account would be locked even though I already have stated that I never posted anything vulgar or prohibited or used a third party app. I actually didn’t post at all that week. They don’t deserve the popularity that they have because they really don’t care about us and this situations shows being that soooo many people are having the same exact problem for no reason (check their Twitter account) They’re not even making an attempt to fix the glitch that they have in their system. So many years of memories and photos gone for no reason and they don’t care because they have a million more people who support their app. I don’t expect them to respond because they don’t respond to anyone unless they send a stupid link. Ive literally seen some accounts post drugs and porn daily but they have never been banned or suspended. Snapchat is a joke."
"I’m not sure that this is what I should be saying in a review, but while Snapchat is cool and stuff, there are some things that annoy me. 
1) Dark mode PLEASE
2) In private story settings, you can see who’s on a private story by scrolling through their names that appear horizontally on the screen (if that makes sense) or the checker hames in your entire best friends list. It’s really inconvenient and hard to keep track of, so it would just be better if there was a straightforward list of everyone on your private story. Please. 
3) Also with private stories or maybe just stories in general, theres this glitch where it keeps looking like you haven’t watched your own story (like it has the blue ring around it) and when you watch it, it shows you something that has expired from your story. Then after, you can’t watch the rest of your story and the blue ring stays there. The only way you can fix it, I think, is by deleting the story and making a new one. But that’s a pain, so fix it please."
"Every update, I and many people I know are being pushed away from using Snapchat. The app has distanced itself from its community and doesn’t listen to criticism. It constantly pushes out updates that not only implement complicated and useless features but it gets rid of the features that made using Snapchat in the past fun, not to mention how disgusting the UI has become, first with stories scrolling going horizontally and the addition of all these promoted or featured stories. Then stories were also put on the chat page. Managing or removing friends has become more difficult as well as seeing who hasn’t added you back. The camera is becoming to cluttered but there are too many features to condense it without adding 10x as many steps to get to a certain feature. I’m also shocked that in nearly 10 years of being released they haven’t added the ability to remove multiple people at once, this feels like such a simple and important feature. Hopefully Snapchat starts listening to its users rather than going full corporate and implementing features that cause its users to leave the app on a daily basis."
"Snapchat is awesome to have and it’s really well designed as well. Snapchat allows you to text your friends, send photos, and even make your own cameo that allows you to stick yourself into stickers. You can even have your own public profile that allows you to post videos and let the public to see. You can share your location with friends which is cool so you can share your experience with your friends. And then of course, you can post on public stories so friends can contribute to it and private so other people can see but can’t contribute. You can create your bitmoji that shows how you look like. You have a snapscore that represents how many people see your snaps. Snapchat even shows the types of relationships your zodiac has with your friends, how close you are, and stuff like that. If you have a group chat, you can see things like who is most active. I recommend this app to hang with friends! 😀"
"Previous to the account ban streak Snapchat went on it was my go to app. Middle of last year (2021) Snapchat changed the guidelines putting A.I. removing anything against guideline, kind of like Facebook, this lead to an untold amount of account to be terminated. This lead loyal users who have been on the app for years, saved memories, first love pictures, lost loved ones, old friends who’ve grown apart, gained friends of friends, and most IMPORTANT TO SNAPCHAT watched several hundreds if not thousands of your ads, to become dependent on the app for their social life. Then Snapchat’s new update went and destroyed these teens social lives, memories, and who they’ve become. People deserve at minimum a warning to at least retrieve their memories back. This app caused untold hardship as I read the reviews, it ripped these accounts from people for using the app no different than they were before, the user’s privacy was taken away from then at a simple auto update. This app is not the same, Snapchat has sadly lost its hard build reputation. 
Also considering Snap’s 2021 Annual Revenue was 4.12 Billion U.S. Dollar they should have some what of a customer service line. 0/10."
"Anyone else post weed all the time on your PRIVATE STORY?? Yeah me too… until my birthday after getting ready I checked my phone, open up snap and oh I’m logged out?? Tried to log in and I’m banned??! I check my email and I’m told i broke community guidelines?!! How? Weed is legal in my state!! And on top of that it was my birthday!! Do they give any warning to this ban of your account? NO! No they do not! This app is disgusting! Here’s a bright idea how about instead of banning people from using the app completely you ban them from POSTING for a short time or at least give them a good warning while you prohibiting posting, then ban them! Like I lost all of my high school memories basically since I put them in My Eyes Only! Because keep in mind when they do this and lock you out you can get your PUBLIC data back, not your private stuff back. That gets deleted just like your account! Snapchat you need to change your ways! This is ridiculous! I don’t even have minors on my friend list that I know of, and I do know that there were none on my private when I did post my weed, a PRIVATE story should PRIVATE not for Snapchat to take someone’s memories and pictures away!"
"I used to love Snapchat until they had randomly deleted my account. If you try reaching out for any sort of support you are greeted with automated messages and no sort of help whatsoever. I’ve spent the last several days trying to reach someone to ask why my account and all the memories I had were deleted, but after jumping through several hoops and looking online I’ve come to learn that Snapchat does this. I hadn’t done anything illegal or harmful towards anyone and got my account deleted randomly, which is funny because so many illegal activities are facilitated through their app, so while they do have things set in place to prevent illegal activity their system doesn’t actually stop them and deletes other accounts that remotely look like they don’t follow their TOS. The worst part is that after your account is deleted, Snapchat will ban your devices from being able to create a new account, so after several years of being with them since the very beginning I can no longer use their app because their system is broken. 

Reasonably though Snapchat was fun and I do miss it. But please do not trust them or rely on this app for anything."
"It’s been probably since May since I lost my account the account I’ve had since freshman year of high-school. With a 500,000 snap score I was a loyal user of Snapchat using it everyday. I lost my account randomly one day the customer service sucked and there’s no way to stop false bans. My phone is currently and probably still will be banned for life. I either have to get a new phone or just continue life. I would love to use snap it’s an amazing service infill you have technical problems. I never even got a reason for the ban just 1. Spam 2. illegal 3. Bullying not so sure about 3. But they couldn’t even tell me the reasons. Now honestly I don’t care about the memories because that’s whatever. At least let me get a new account to snap people. I probably will never get another Snapchat account again especially since I got a brand new iPhone 12 so I can’t exactly get rid of it for a different phone. Honestly so disappointed and I wanna see more people give negative reviews do Snapchat will actually see us people that just wanna use there service again that got no reason for loosing our accounts. That’s all I’m gonna say."
I never really hated Snapchat until now Snapchat is really acting up right now and this needs to fix for an example I had an account for like one year and then it wants to log me out so I think nothing about it and log back in but then it says that my account has been temporarily locked and to go to this website I go on there and like tell me why my account is probably locked but does not help at all so I want us to fix right now it’s been two months and I still don’t have it so how long is gonna be locked for I need Snapchat then I try making a new account and it still doesn’t work like that needs to be fixed right now at least make a new account. But it still don’t work and I can’t log back in and I am not the only one with this issue and it needs to be fixed right now because I wanna make memories and I just don’t like it so can I please have my account back or make a new account I don’t care but really and I hope Snapchat sees us because I really want them to fix this and I keep on reporting and I tell people to keep on reporting how bad it is right now fix it please
Snapchat is a great app also very very frustrating I love Snapchat don’t get me wrong but it keeps locking my friends out of their accounts and me my old Snapchat account got permanently locked for no reason I have never sent spams or anything like that and even if we make a new account we can’t add everybody that we had added on our old account because we’re not gonna remember user names of 2000 people or like that so if snapchat stops locking people out of their accounts it will be a five star review also my friend recently got locked out of her account that had all her friends and then she made a new account on that same day and that she got permanently locked again so please if you can fix this problem I will give you five star review because I had Snapchat for a really really long time for over five years now and I have never got locked out of my account it started locking people out of their account in 2020-anywhy I hope you get this problem fixed-much love
"So snapchat is a great app and I have been using the app for around 6 years now. I love the recent adds to the app such as: searching filters from local artists, snap group chat calling, and the timer for photos and videos. One thing I believe that Snapchat should have added a while back ago is the ability to select every user you have a streak with automatically. This would help snapchatters not take the time to click all their streaks and it would make the process more enjoyable. Also, snapchat has been having a couple bug fixes that are not up to par, but that are fixable. After you post on your story, your views somehow drop a couple hundred after around 12 hours past. Also, sometimes you watch the same stories over and over again. However, since these are minor and fixable errors that can be fixed with an update, the app still stays my most used app. It’s a great way to connect with friends & family and is one of the premier social media outlets."
"my snap has a recurring issue that i cant seem to fix. ill be using it fine and then all of the sudden that lovely little gray bar pops up at the top of my screen that says “cannot refresh” i cant send snaps and i cant receive them. i tried turning off my wifi, turning off my data and turning it back on again. doesnt work. ive tried just turning off my data. doesnt work. ive tried just turning off my wifi. doesnt work. ive tried shutting down my phone. and you guessed it, IT DOESNT WORK. i cant even log out and log back in because it “failed to connect to the server” or some bs like that. i have to delete the app and then wait all day/night until it works again. if i try to log in after deleting it and redownloading it, it says “connection error” however everything else works on my phone, tiktok, insta, yt, vsco, and safari. theres nothing wrong with my connection. there is something wrong with the app. this is extremely frustrating and disappointing bc snapchat is my main source of communication and social media. id really like to figure out what is wrong with this and im very upset that snapchat isnt better then this. fix this."
"This is the first review I’ve ever left on anything so it’s kind of bad that you’re the first a n y t h i n g I’ve chosen to do so on. I know I’ve used up almost all of storage, but it’s frustrating how I can’t even get a video to load that’s in my memories from even a week ago.. also, it would be sosososooo amazing if editing the length of a video was a feature for every post<3 I know I’m not the only one who has a cackle at the end of a something I documented that RUINS a vid I take or even something else I’m just trying to cut out for a public post👀 and if you’re at it, PLEASE allow for people to be able to SEARCH who’s viewed their story, or at the very least allow me to scroll myself to scroll to the bottom after a long day and search for something special haha I just don’t like how there’s a ‘+ one hundred something more’ people have viewed your story but you can’t know who bc snap doesn’t allow that🤡 sorry if this rant was aggressive sc, I really do love your app I just wish you would listen to the people a little more to improve🤍"
"I give snap chat a 4 star rating but that’s only because i like the app but lately I’ve noticed every time I try to scroll through my memories it takes me to my Home Screen I’ve already tried powering my phone off and turning back on twice. Neither of the times worked. I updated my phone bc I thought maybe that was the cause.... NO it wasn’t that. After that I just updated snap chat... I went and tested if it stopped yet but it hasn’t, it still takes me to my Home Screen. Please if you can, fix this problem! It also won’t even let me open the app now; it will show me a black screen and go straight to my Home Screen. I’ve powered off my phone and it still did it. I’ve tried deleting it twice and neither times have worked. It just keeps doing the same thing. I’m really angry at your update bc it was also annoying how when you go to view your own story and snap score; etc. you couldn’t swipe down you have to press the arrow. I liked it better before."
"I’ve had Snapchat for 4 years and last night my whole Snapchat was deleted with The last 4 years of my life just gone. I’ve lost so many pictures and videos of family members, animals that are no longer with me, my childhood house I grew up in that is now gone. Everything is gone, they gave me no warning what so ever. I tried contacting them about getting my pictures and videos back, not even caring about the account because nothing is ever truly deleted. I feel like I lost apart of myself because I documented everything on that app, and they ripped that away from me. My settings were set to not have everything backed up onto my camera roll because I didn’t think I needed to ever do that cause I just had snap to look back on, but not anymore. I have tried all that I can to contact them on their website and on Twitter but they were no help. I want my justice for snatching away the last 4 years of my life away. I will find a way. Do not ever trust this app because it can all be taken away from you in a matter of seconds. I have been in such distraught about this situation and they aren’t doing anything about it."
you guys really need to look into your new algorithm for detecting “illegal drug sales” because A LOT of people are having their accounts wrongfully terminated and it’s just not cool when you guys also act as a cloud storage almost for people’s memories. can you guys please look into that. and can you guys please start an appeal process for all accounts that have been locked or terminated in the last month because i promise you most of them did not violate your terms. and you guys should highly consider giving people warnings!!!! every social media gives you a warning they don’t just terminate you. Or if you guys can’t do that you should AT LEAST let people retrieve their memories once you terminate their account. I’ve seen so many people trying to get in touch with you guys who have lost memories of people who have died. myself to be included. please try to understand how important photos and videos are when that’s all you have left of someone. I just want my memories back. 7 years of memories and 90% of them were ONLY on my snapchat because I thought they would be safe their but now they are gone. Please let me get them back.
"I love SC and use it daily. Recently there must have been an update because things aren’t working right. I blocked several people from viewing my story, yet almost all of them ended up viewing it. This happened twice in the past week. I never used to have that problem. Another issue is people whose stories I muted are now showing up over in the stories section... that never used to happen either. I’ve also opened the app and saw I had a message but was never notified the person was typing or had sent anything. Small thing but I’ll mention it... when sending videos from memories it now tells the person it’s from memories and the date... that’s a new feature that would have been nice to be notified of lol. I usually don’t complain about updates and just deal with whatever changes happen but these bugs are frustrating. What is the point of being able to block people from your story if you’re going to wake up to a lovely surprise that they all saw it anyway..."
"My friend Owen Gisi and I (Kamryn) would like to give a few examples on what to make snap a better place. We would love for you guys to give consideration and time into this paragraph because we have really good ideas on how to make snap a better place to communicate. To start off, we would make a button to open all snaps at once and to send streaks all at the same time with people you have streaks with. Secondly people of snap want to be able to change their boring usernames. To include we also want to be able to pick our best friends for our best friends list and not have random people on it. Continuing we would like the snap logo to be blue on certain dates and make the ghost into a goat cause snap is lit and amazing. Lastly we would like a dark mode because on Apple iPhones there is a dark mode that most people choose this mode because it’s something different. If you could put this into consideration Gisi and I would gladly appreciate it. Thank you for your time."
"I’ve had my Snapchat account since 2015. I’ve been through thick and thin with this account. I had almost 6 and what soon would’ve been seven years of memories on account, but no longer do I, as today I have been banned for no reason. I opened snap to see someone wanting to do Sfs with me (Shout out 4 Shout out on each other’s story), and thought, “Sure, Why Not?”. Well, it’s all I posted and Snapchat seen this as, “Violating Terms Of Service”. Instead of a warning nor temporary lock, my account is permanently banned and so is my new phone. Me and my best friend had a streaks count of 1,110+ that we started about 3 years ago, and I lost it. Also, to add insult to injury, I no longer can contact another friend of mine because Snapchat is the only social platform we connected thru. I know you guys are trying your best to have a happy community, but the way you surveillance your own app is hilariously stupid, no offense. I will not be raising my review back to 5 stars until I see my account back. I’ve never broke the terms or used any kind of 3rd party apps on this platform, and now all of a sudden I’m violating somehow. Good day!"
"I despise the new update’s set up. Especially that black bar that just chills there when you’re taking a snap. I don’t like how snapmaps has its own little “page” either. Before it was much nicer when you could just scroll down and look at it. I don’t think snapmaps needs its own tab on the menu bar thing. Snapchat just disorganized now. Additionally, there is this button that I’ve always hated since they added. The button which I’m referring to is when you make a snapchat, if you press that button it will automatically add to your story without asking you. The amount of times I’ve accidentally hit that button and posted something on my story that I didn’t want to post is crazy. Get rid of that button. There’s no purpose for it. It does the same function as if someone was to go next then press “add to story”. And at least if someone does it that way, it decreases the chances of posting something on their story that they didn’t mean to post. Snapchat, stop disappointing me with your updates."
"I am not one to leave or even write a review but this has really upset me. I’ve been a snap user since 2016 and now they decide to lock all my accounts. I have read the terms of service and privacy policy and my account doesn’t have the right to be terminated. I’ve followed all the steps and I even deleted my virtual private network, reset my phone, tried to unlock the accounts from the Snapchat page itself but it’s no chance. I can log in but I can’t use the account at all. It will send me right back to the log in screen. You see I’m not sure if this is a bug or major glitch but its also happening to a lot of people so I know I’m not the only one. Before all of this like in February my accounts were working perfectly fine and I never had a problem with Snapchat because I loved it . Now things have changed and I can’t even make a new account and log out because then I’ll stay logged out. I really hope I can restore my accounts because they didn’t have anything on it except for pictures of myself (selfies) which I don’t see how snap chooses to terminate my account even my posts don’t violate the community guidelines ."
"I’ve had Snapchat for 3 maybe 4 years now and never had any issues with it. In fact, it’s one of two ways I keep in touch with pretty much everyone I know and now that it’s glitching out and crashing constantly, it’s really getting annoying. I never had any of these issues with the crashing until a week or two ago and it really makes me want to use it less and less the more it happens. It’s always right when I open the app, it crashes, or when I take a picture, the app crashes and the picture I took is gone. I thought it was because of other apps I could be using like Pandora or discord but even when I’m not using something else it still happens constantly. It’s to the point that I can’t send streaks or post anything on my story because every time I take a picture it crashes. Every. Time. This doesn’t happen to any other apps on my phone, so I know it has to just be Snapchat. Dunno if anyone else is having this issue but it’s really upsetting me."
Snapchat is an app I use on the daily. I love being able to talk to all my friends and making new ones. The past two days my Snapchat has been acting really strange. When I attempt to add something to my story it won’t upload and it asks me to try again. When it does go through and uploads it says no one has viewed it. Even when it’s been up to 7 hours and usually I have a lot of people view it by then. Another problem that is happening is that snaps that was sent to me at night come through the next morning. Not only these problems but also it shows were someone has put something new on their story and I tap on it but yet it won’t show me the new snap. Just the older ones. A lot of people have been talking about this problem and I think the Snapchat team could look to see what they can do to fix it. I really enjoy this app and I would hate to not be able to use it anymore. Thank you!
"Honestly I love snapchat, it’s the only social media I have. But instead of sprucing up the layout, how about we fix these bugs? It’ll force close. Glitch my whole phone. Won’t let me send streaks or upload. Won’t allow me to access or find my snappers. It’ll show notifications when there isn’t any. And it’ll also send me notifications of messages that I got hours to days ago that I have already read and or replied to. And it runs slow as hell. It’s definitely not my phone, as I’ve checked for this multiple times. It’s terrible. It needs to be cleaned and fixed. Seriously. It plays my snaps out of order, load stories I’ve already seen, resends messages I’ve already opened, and force changes password. I signed out and when I tried to sign back in, entering the correct credentials with full WiFi, it says there’s a bad internet connection when there isn’t, causing me to not be able to sign back in. I’m a public figure and young upcoming actress and Snapchat is one of my networks for me being able to communicate, be informed, and reach my audience and this bugging is getting in a way of a lot of that."
"I love using snapchat and have been using it now for almost as long as it’s been active. It’s pretty convenient and I use it everyday. Sometimes though I have notifications  showing up such as someone is typing when they aren’t and the red circle notification outside the app doesn’t go away immediately. It’s not too much of a bother but something small. I think one feature I don’t like is that on the “for you” underneath subscriptions you can only hide the stories and not block them. Plus I hate seeing influencers that have nothing to do with me. I can only hide them and they keep popping back up. It’s not really catered to me and I could do without seeing for you underneath my subscription stories, I’d rather the for you be another tab. Other than that I like the funny filters, the stickers and bitmoji we can use. Snapchat is usually my go to for group chats with friends and I’d rather use snap than give my number to someone I just met"
I’ve had snapchat since 2015 and up until now everything was perfectly fine till a couple days ago they logged me out and deleted my account supposing to me violating their terms of service. Which never have i ever violated anything which really confused me and it upset me because without any warning they just banned me and took away ALL my memories and everything that i had made friends with over time. Also on my backup it says i’m temporarily locked from my account but when i went on their website to unlock it says on there permanently banned on both backups. And i’m just really mad because on the actual app it doesn’t say that just temporarily locked. And it’s disappointing that snap has done this. I’ve literally loved snapchat for the longest time and now there is no way of me getting back to my friends and anything that i had. Just very upsetting. And never did they tell me why or what may have caused the violation. Also don’t know why whatever happened on my main account affects on any of my other.
I could be using snapchat for months no problem...then a new update comes out which is totally useless. nothing has changed except for the look & it looks ugly. this big black border at the bottom is distracting and the swipe into chat feature is gone. i don’t like the idea of tapping to enter a chat. i don’t really know who comes up with the ideas for the updates but i guarantee they don’t use snapchat because wow! i’m giving it three stars because i don’t like the update but i don’t believe i can stop using snapchat. i like the app it’s just usually the updates are...useless. ALSO there is a new update and you can’t HOLD someone’s snap story anymore. so say they had a text all the way at the top...there’s no way you’re gonna see what it says because you can’t hold onto the snap anymore. and it also gets rid of the sound. I WANT TO HEAR IT. i’m holding onto THAT snap because there’s something in THAT snap that i WANT to see or hear. just do us all a favor and stop making useless updates.
"i have had snap since 2014 when the app first released and i have loved having it everyday. it’s an easy and fun way to talk to your friends/family and get a picture of them along with the conversation, especially of those you don’t get to see everyday. it’s also a fun way to take silly pictures with certain filters of cute pictures with some other amazing filters. snap has had lots of changes since 2014 and for the most part i’ve loved them all but this most recent update i’m definitely not a fan of as for others that i’ve talked to about it. it’s way more complicated and a little to extra. i very much miss the way it was before the update and really hope they switch it back! i also didn’t like how it automatically updated to it when i didn’t want it to. i purposely avoided the update after i saw it on someone else’s phone and after awhile it just updated itself."
"snapchat will literally delete ur acct w/o a warning, a proper explanation, nor give you the chance to retrieve YEARS of your data (memories) — AND if you try to reach out to them via twitter, they will send you the SAME robotic message they’ve sent to 1,000s of users. they don’t care at the fact, that they’ve took all of your memories away without a valid warning or explanation.
they don’t care to look into the REASON your acct was deleted. they don’t care abt their users AT ALL, because if they did they would AT LEAST have REAL people responding to your concerns and not ignore you when you’re trying to get something resolved... i’ve been on snapchat since 2014!! the start of it & i’ve never violated anything before — sooo...how come i wasn’t issued a WARNING before my acct was terminated?! i’m a REAL person! not a spammer, scamming, or someone that does pornography, bullying, or anything else that is prohibited! therefore, they should be able to help me... but to top it all off, they’ve completely banned me too — so i can’t ever make a new snapchat. be aware...snapchat doesn’t care abt their users & don’t use their memories, bc u will never see them again if they deletes your acct."
