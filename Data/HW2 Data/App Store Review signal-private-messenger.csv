"The service has now become pretty much useless. I no longer receive an audible or visual notice when people send me a message. Only once I click on the Signal icon  do the alerts actually come in. Now I have to keep opening the app to check for messages.  This is not the case with other messaging platforms. Yes, I allow full permissions for Signal. 

Additionally, I came here to update, but I dare not as Signal now allows third party stickers/ads. This now opens up a backdoor for hackers. Soon, Signal will shut down all users that don‚Äôt update. 

I use to boast how secure Signal was. Obviously the developers of Signal had long term plans to monetize their once highly secure communication service?

What do we expect for Free anyway? Obviously Signal‚Äôs original Mission Statement has changed. Third party advertising has now become a security concern. 

I‚Äôm only here as a means to communicate with other hi level parties who feel safe using this app. That‚Äôs now going to change as word gets out that a backdoor for advertising   has been installed in Signal‚Äôs app. 

Though no communication service is bullet proof, adding an additional layer of script to  monetize Signal, (in my opinion) opens up a serious security breach that will eventually be exploited by hackers. 

Signal is not the only game in town. Once I get all of my contacts to migrate to a more secure app, I‚Äôll be uninstalling Signal, as it doesn't alert me any more anyway. 

Cheers!"
"I don‚Äôt know if this disfunction is related to the particular phone (iPhone XR) that I am using Signal on now or if it is the same on other phones, but the ‚Äúcursor‚Äù control on Signal is a disaster now.  It is a nightmare trying to move the cursor to where you want it, or to highlight a specific section of your message.  I am completely unable to move the cursor more than a couple lines away from its current location at a time (and the text window doesn‚Äôt extend to more than 4 lines tall), so i have to scroll a couple lines away, click somewhere to move the cursor in the direction of where i want it to go, and repeat over and over again until it finally gets there.   If i try to move it further than that, the window just jumps back to the area where it is currently located and moves it to some random location nearby.  
Highlighting a portion of your message is impossible; it jumps from one end of the message to the other and will not allow you to scroll slowly to where you want to stop highlighting.  It is so stupid ~ I recommend typing messages in another app and then pasting it into signal when you are done.   
Also, FYI, if you want to copy text from a signal message, hold your finger on the message and then click on the little icon at the bottom of the screen that looks like two pieces of paper -  nothing will ever appear that says ‚Äúcopy‚Äù."
"Lots of features (Gify, stickers, reacts, self destructing messages), but it requires you to give out your phone number to everyone you talk to, does not allow specifying a different server, and beyond those privacy concerns, it has gone downhill lately in terms of usability and security as well.

It now it forces a PIN even if you don‚Äôt want one. Private keys are sent through the server to enable moving from one device to another. Signal used to store private keys in hardware and it was impossible to export them. This ensured that nobody could ever covertly get your key. They removed this security protection and do not even provide an option to use the more secure key storage. The Signal developers could have enabled a smooth device transfer and kept the keys in hardware by having the old key sign the new one so others will 1.) know that the new key is new 2.) know that it is legitimate, and 3.) be able to verify the move using another communication channel if they suspect something is amiss. The Signal developers decided against this.

Given the developers‚Äô recent decisions, and their unwillingness to allow people to use their system without divulging their phone numbers, earns this app 3 stars. If they put more focus on privacy, security, and allowed connecting to private servers, it could easily be a 5-star app."
"This actually affects everyone, but why in the world did they take away the audible notifications of incoming messages, when you have a thread open. It‚Äôs necessary to keep checking back to see if a new message came in. It is now easier to lock the phone between each message to just hear when a new message comes in. This was a really stupid change.
They added these nice new reactions you can make to messages, just like iMessage. I can put them on other peoples messages, but since I‚Äôm blind and they didn‚Äôt bother making those reactions accessible to voiceover, I can‚Äôt tell if anyone reacts to my messages or how they reacted, or if the correct reaction got on a message I reacted to.
And as I‚Äôm reading through messages in an open thread, sometimes the screen will just randomly scroll to messages from six weeks ago or something. It says loading Messages, or something like that, and the next thing I know I‚Äôm looking at a conversation from a month ago. Then I have to find the scroll bar, and drag it all the way back down to the bottom, or kill the app and open it again, in order to get back to where I was just reading. And if what I was reading was a very involved detailed message, I have to start back over from the beginning of it.
They have really forgotten about voiceover users in the last several versions."
"I have gotten so many people on this app since many years ago. Then I tried to send a big file and it has a limiter on it now. So I had to go to Telegram for large file transfers. They have to be 100% secure. I thought Telegram and you were the same company or related. But a recent article on secure apps said Telegram is not open-source. I thought I remember it being that. Anyway, when faceBook bought WhatsApp I went on there and told about 50-people on it that the data mining user abuser Zuckerberg bought this company and top people that started the app bailed over questionable ‚Äútweaks‚Äù he wanted them to do so they each resigned as got worse and now all are gone. At least the privacy-pillars of the company. This was 5-star all the way until you did away with unlimited bandwidth. Why?? Does it clog or bottleneck the system? How can Telegram get away with it and you can‚Äôt? Any plausible way of brining it back? It really the only app I fully trust besides just encrypting and decrypting with keys. Which is a pain and has its limitations too. Huge, huge fan brought 30-40 people here from FB-WhatsApp. 
 Just bring back the bandwidth please! I will change my review, promise."
"I was really happy to begin to use Signal because I was reading reviews that said that the telegram app is owned now by Google which is a spy/database of everything you ever use the Internet for. I read that there is a button you need to push in Telegram settings to make your communications private. Probably most people never find out about that. I felt it was a betrayal of trust.  I thought that signal was more trustworthy. However, I did see there was also a similar setting in signal that may be exactly like telegram. I guess true privacy is  impossible?  One other puzzling thing is that after entering my new signal password I discovered that when I tried to use it for the first time (and ever since then), the locked screen password entry page for my iPhone pops up instead.  Does it give Apple text-message-censorship capabilities in Signal‚Äôs app?  My entire intent is to have greater privacy, not to have my personal (I thought) text messages leaked to ... anyone."
"When I first installed signal after quitting Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and Whatsappü§¨, I loved the app because of its concern for user privacy. Specially for End-to-End Encryption.üòç But the. After using some days I found that, i cant save photos and videos directly to my gallery. I was very disappointed because downloading every picture one by one bye opening them was very amnoying. But eventually you fixed thisüòçüòç Thank you so much for this thing. This was the only feature for what i used telegram. But Signal still need one more thing to do. Work on your stickers. Signal stickers are not that much unique and impression making just like Telegram. Telegram has the best emoji amd sticker with animations and everyone loves this. Please work on your stickers. & yes. Never betray your audience. Never share users data to any data brokers. Its a request. üòá wish you all the best ü•∞"
"The perfect app. I love this for my long distance relationship. We don‚Äôt have to spend tons of money for international calls, we just use signal. Plus we each have tons of sticker packs and have so much fun sending the stickers and leaving each other voice messages. Love the sense of privacy as well. It‚Äôs great that signal also saves all your photos. I can easily go back and find his selfies or video attachments. Even a search feature for the chat so I can find a specific conversation if needed. Couldn‚Äôt hardly ask for a better app. 

The only suggestions I would have is to have an edit option (like discord has) so I can fix typos easily. And I would like to be able to have that ‚Äúdelete for everyone‚Äù option be always available. Especially since all the media we send stays under the media tab, it would be nice to clear out photos or videos we don‚Äôt need anymore. 

Thanks a bunch !"
"It needs to be as sufficient as WhatsApp. Multiple calls easier and able to share files, pics and videos etc. Needs a bit more work. I would like to be able to use it solely instead of relying on WhatsApp for the things that signal can‚Äôt. I do love signal but needs to be perfected !!!! ASAP.  should be friendlier to conduct business as well personal stuff. WhatsApp is not better than signal. But Signal needs to grow some balls for all the people that just signed up for it. And not let them down. As they would look for another platform that can do all the aforementioned!!! Over all it‚Äôs a great app.

For one. Sharing a file, image or a video is not possible when pushing the share button as the menu opens with all the other apps to share with. You can share with all except signal. As it freezes. You push on the signal icon and nothing happens. Then you‚Äôre forced to copy and paste it. It‚Äôs time consuming. Pls fix this issue as to maybe fix it to where you can also see WHEN a recipient read the msg. THAT WOULD BE GREAT. !!!"
"This is simply the best privacy app with everything neatly bundled into it. It has a nice authentication feature, sms & mms messaging & disappearing messages with people [to keep them clean if you‚Äôd like], calls, and keeps it all private, app switch privacy [keeping the screen blank for privacy while switching apps so wandering eyes cannot see the screen], and many more features packed into this powerhouse.  To anyone experiencing any issues with calls, make sure your notifications are on and properly set with the app, and look into the settings in the app itself and it easily shows how to have your calls show up with the name [if you would like to] or just a call without a name. The settings are a breeze and make it very easy to understand. 

Very rarely you‚Äôll have to re-register for push notifications, but that‚Äôs also very easily accomplished.

If I could rate higher than 5 stars I would. 10 stars out of 5 stars is more like it..."
"With everything going on in the world today, it's nice to know there are alternatives to having your private conversations listened to, or your texts read by anyone else except for the people you sent them to. 

While I think most people are not involved in anything that would warrant any government agency from looking into the private conversations between people, I can understand the need for any government to have the right to acquire the permissions necessary for the purposes of national security. 

In the United States, that bar and burden of proof to seek these exceptions is extremely high, as it should be. And, (at least at this point), they are extremely rare. 

I am happy to have found a way to feel confident that my messages are not being scrutinized by any other eyes than those I intended to see the message. 

The app is easy to navigate and use, and the response is lightning fast. I have had very good experiences with texting and with voice calls as well, with the tools to know that the message was both sent and received. Sending a voice text is also easy and incredibly fast compared to other texting platforms. 

The sending and receiving of large files is also very easy and fast. 

I would highly recommend this app if you're looking for a secure channel of communication with both text and voice."
"C‚Äômon people‚Ä¶ Are you comfortable with any random person reading the messages you write to your friends or family? How easily can your OWN words be taken out of context and used against you?

Anyone who has the POWER to access your communications, and has the time and resources to do it OBVIOUSLY wants to compromise YOUR position.. Why make it easier for them???

Survive.. Here is a simple tool built by people who value one of the few tenets that make our existence free‚Ä¶ PRIVACY"
"I know you guys are busy of late with user migrating over.  I have had the app since it‚Äôs release.  One thing I was wondering is if Send with Siri functionality will be added in any upcoming future release.  Where this really comes in handy is 2 fold for me; 1. In the car with CarPlay, so I can just speak the message without needing to see the screen.  2. Anywhere else I might be in iOS, like a WEB Page & want to share that with a friend.  While the Signal app, shows in the list of app, that takes multiple taps to invoke the send option, but for apps that support it, users & the respective app, will show as a ‚Äúrecent‚Äù item, which allows you to save multiple steps in selecting both the app & the person to deliver it to in a single touch.  Even the most recent update this week, added an extra step to have to tap (tho I know it allows for sending to multiple people).  So, I would love to see sending with Siri & iOS share sheet ‚ÄúRecent‚Äù support.  RMM"
"I started using Signal about two years ago, after being disillusioned with Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts and WhatsApp. I tried Telegram and then Signal. Signal had some polish missing, but it was by far the best in terms of security and also in terms of my ability to communicate. I can easily keep conversations going on my phone and multiple desktops independently, something I believe no other secure chat application has, and I don't have to worry about big tech spying or censorship.

Signal today is in my opinion a much better experience than Facebook or Google delivers, or even what you get from Telegram. The UI design is better than WhatsApp at this point. In fact, I noticed recently that Facebook Messenger copied the Signal UI for giving arbitrary emoji responses to messages.

Download the app. You won't regret it."
"Love the app, and until this last version I would say that all it really needed was a way to assign any custom iPhone alert to an incoming message.  The current version gives options, but doesn‚Äôt allow you to use any alerts on the phone.  That, however, is a customization, so no big deal, but this last version broke the attachments.  Now when I attach anything from the Signal side or to Signal through the phone side, it doesn‚Äôt immediately show up.  Sometimes you can exit the chat itself and go back in, and sometimes if you shut down the app and reopen they will show, but most of the time I have to wait for a reply for it to show, so I never know if it was sent.  I‚Äôve also noticed that it sometimes puts my messages in the wrong order.  For instance, I will see the reply above the original message.  That, too, eventually fixes itself but it‚Äôs very annoying and has only started happening since the newest version was installed."
"I am unable to call my wife using Signal. We have poor cell phone reception in our apartment, so we regularly use WhatsApp to call each other when one of us is at home but the other is not. I have tried to call my wife using Signal multiple times without success, however, WhatsApp and FaceTime will complete the call no problem. I am able to call friends and family who are in another country, but not my wife. Messages work fine, only audio and video calls to her don‚Äôt work. If Signal wants to truly take some of WhatsApp‚Äôs user base, they need to improve their software. 
Addendum: I am also having multiple issues trying to attach photos to messages. The app simply crashes when I try to attach photos from within the app. (This is on my iPhone and iPad.) I can send photos using the Photos app sharesheet, but not from within Signal. I keep hoping the next update will fix these issues, but they persist."
"I was a very happy customer of this app since I found out about it but the insane race to the lowest common denominator, adding ‚Äústickers‚Äù to an app whose main purpose is secure and reliable communications have broken the application.  Messages do not send, or send after hours, and in one epic case over a day later. No other application has an issue connecting to the internet or sending messages, including WhatsApp and FB Messenger. The ‚Äúsending‚Äù icon gets stuck and nothing happens. If you go to the settings, you can see the ‚Äúnetwork status‚Äù switching between ‚Äúconnected‚Äù ‚Äúconnecting‚Äù and ‚Äúoffline‚Äù And before anyone blames my settings, I made sure the app has all the recommended rights, low battery mode is disabled and no app or connection restrictions are set on the app. This happens on both WiFi and LTE, so it is not tied to a bad WiFi or data connection, especially since I have tested it on multiple WiFi networks and not just my home one.  So, tl; dr, add stickers, make communications impossible. Great move , I hope people enjoy their little cats and stuff while I look for a proper secure communications app..."
"I love the fact that signal has an end to end encryption, and we don‚Äôt have to worry about our data being collected and sold. However, my family and I recently moved from WhatsApp group chat to signal group chat. Sending multiple picturesOn the WhatsApp group chat was possible, but sending them on the signal group chat doesn‚Äôt seem to be. I have an iPhone XR, and I try to select multiple photos from inside the app to send to my family, but an error message appears for about a quarter of a second before disappearing, and doesn‚Äôt work. I also try going into my photos app, selecting multiple photos and sending them via signal that way, but it also doesn‚Äôt work. How can we make it so that we can send multiple pictures easily? I don‚Äôt have this problem with text message app, Facebook messenger app, WhatsApp, or telegram. Only signal. I want to keep using this app, but the photo problem makes it very hard"
"Guess who just joined signal! Any one of anyone on your phone contact list who just joined signal, or, better yet maybe even you! I really love the security feature of blasting to everyone in your contact list that has signal that you just joined signal! It's perfect for maintaining secrecy and discretion, letting everyone in my whole contacts with signal know I just joined signal helps me signal to them that security is one of my primary concerns. This way, anyone else trying to be discreet and secure is fully aware that I'm also available for secret, private p2p direct IM. It's kinda like, okay, if you're on signal and part of the elite secrecy, end-to-end encryption specialists, the very first thing I'd like to so is broadcast to everyone I know with the app that I'm finally part of the club! Really pretty genius feature!!"
"On 3 separate occasions, Signal has completely failed to notify me of messages (and yes, I have all notifications turned on (sound, banner, lock screen, etc.)).  Given that I only use Signal to talk to a couple people roughly once a week because it's the only messenger program they use, 3 times is a lot!  None of my other messaging apps have this problem, and it's totally unacceptable from an app whose primary purpose is communication.

On two of those three occasions, Signal did finally give me the notifications the moment I reopened the app to double check the conversations several hours later.  On the remaining occasion, I was expecting Signal to potentially fail again, and so I kept the app open and switched to it every few minutes.  *Despite this*, the thread only updated the next morning, finally notifying me of a message that had been sent to me the day before.  During this entire period I had continuous internet access.

For me, the added security Signal affords is completely overshadowed by this glaring deficit."
"I love signal, and I try to get everyone I know to use it. There‚Äôs a lot of friction for that, unfortunately, but such is life. Thanks to the developers for making a secure mode of communication.

I‚Äôm giving this four stars for two reasons:
1) signal calls are much less reliable than regular Wi-Fi calls from other apps. I‚Äôm not really sure why this is, but it seems like when I call others sometimes the phone just doesn‚Äôt ring. I‚Äôve called my wife‚Äôs phone while it was in the same room to test this, but I‚Äôve seen it happen with others numbers too (I.e. it‚Äôs not just her phone from what I can tell). Dead reliable calling would really help me recruit more friends to this app.

2) please please please make it so the app can go into wide mode when the phone is turned on its side. For those of us with large hands and normal size iPhones typing on the portrait width keyboard is somewhere between annoying and painful. One must crook one‚Äôs thumb at pretty sharp angles to hit all the keys especially those on the palm adjacent side of the keyboard. I have no idea why this app doesn‚Äôt have this feature when most apps seem to. Honestly if the App Store didn‚Äôt allow typing in this fashion I may not have written this review! 

Thanks again devs for a safe channel of communication."
"In today's world do we really know if this works or not? There is no way to tell. If it works as described, and so far has been easy to use, that's great. The key here is to stop putting your life online for the entire world to see. It would be great if somehow you could tell if the thing works as described. In any event it seems better than other apps out there.
I used this to talk to my daughter when she was in St. Thomas because our data plan doesn't cover that area. We were both on wifi and it worked flawlessly. We incurred no extra charges. I'll keep this one around because of this and it's secure rating so I am increasing my rating to 5 stars.
Finally, this message app is bullet fast, like almost instant. Great app. üëçüèª I like it 100% better then iMessages."
"Hey signal I love this app I appreciate an app that can respect my privacy but recently I have been having issues receiving messages. Often I get messages but no notifications and sometimes they all come in at once in a large batch if someone was sending message during a period of time. This use to happen sometimes but now it seems to be happening more and that‚Äôs not good because sometimes the messages are time sensitive and very important so please would you address this issue. And I would gladly give you 5 stars if it is addressed.

***update***
Previous issues were fixed but after most recent update the keyboard will now cover over top of the current conversation which I find very annoying please fix this thanks."
Everything about this app is pretty much spot on it is the best way to chat with your friends and not feel nervous of people watching. The timer feature is extremely useful in allows both parties to set a Time limit on the message very helpful. I have been using this app for almost 2 years now and have sent all my friends over only way to communicate. Reason for writing this review is I would like to change one option if that is something you guys would consider and that is changing the calling feature so it gives you another menu so you don‚Äôt just click it and it calls right away and tells the user that you try to call them. Just make some other second screen that allows you to confirm the call but other than that this app is perfect.
"While the concept of this app is good, it cannot live up to its name. There are numerous bugs, and none of them are getting resolved. The most critical bug is that you cannot send videos to people, even short 1-2 minute videos. It kees circling and never ends up sending. Also, this often happens while sending photos as well, which is odd. How can someone switch to Signal without using two of the most utilized and essential features of a messaging app? 

Additionally, there are several other bugs, but the two mentioned above are the most critical. Before I end this review, I have to mention: for the love of God, Signal, please consider adding a proper backup&restore feature. It would also be nice to transfer my data & chat to a second device like telegram and continue where I left off in my original device. 

There is certainly a lot of room for improvement. I, for one, will not use nor commit to Signal just yet."
"Question: If I use the ‚Äúreply to‚Äù feature, on the recipient‚Äôs screen, do they see ‚Äúreplying to you‚Äù or would they see ‚Äúreplying to their name?‚Äù I had changed a contact‚Äôs name in my phone and didn‚Äôt realize until after I‚Äôd hit send that I don‚Äôt want them to see what I‚Äôve re-named them in my contacts list. 
So on my screen, it says ‚Äúreplying to contact‚Äôs name.‚Äù  (I don‚Äôt usually use the reply-to feature, which quotes the message.) But I have a message from a different contact who used the reply-to feature to me to quote something and what I see on my screen is ‚Äúreplying to you.‚Äù (Not ‚Äúreplying to my name.‚Äù) Can anyone at Signal confirm whether the recipient can see what I see on my sent screen or if they see a different screen saying ‚Äúreplying to you?‚Äù Thank you."
"This supposed encrypted messaging is similar to all the other messaging apps. But many developers like all browsers don‚Äôt recognize it and often does not put the links and photos directly into Signal. Work arounds are easy to do. I often have to cut and paste into my mail app and then cut and paste into Signal. A bit painful at times. Often I find myself just going back to using Apple‚Äôs messenger. I trust Apple more than other texting apps. I used to trust WhatsApp but not as much anymore as it is a Facebook app. It too is supposed to be encrypted. Most people around the world use WhatsApp or Apple Messenger. But in reality if you are really worrying about total privacy, stay in a cave and never use any electronics. Or develop a private encryption that requires special changing coding -decoding books. All in all, its fun seeing old friends appear on Signal as it gains popularity."
"I like the privacy and protection Signals offers, end to end. 
 What I do find annoying is the inability to retrieve your password or key to change in the very likely instance when you forget your password and/or lock yourself out, misplace 36 numbers and you‚Äôre done, finished. You lose all your contacts. I get the security aspect but it‚Äôs rather unsettling knowing I mistake and you loose everything.
Additionally I recently had to replace my phone and the restore process would not work not matter what I tried. The app is great but I question the security when key features fail.
And as of recent the app has been not working properly, can‚Äôt call out, calls not connecting messages not being received, what‚Äôs up as of late?"
"Updated review: I have really tried to give this app a long-term chance but I am continuously frustrated with its lack of ability to handle voice messages. If something interrupts your message, for example, a low battery notice, you will lose the entire recording. I still experience situations where messages are lost with no explanation. It is baffling and the frequency of these events is enough for me to ditch it altogether. I do not understand how Signal is not taking this opportunity of so many people moving over from WhatsApp to improve this particular aspect of their app. Goodbye Signal. 

Prior review: I appreciate how secure this app is, but it loses voice messages if you don‚Äôt tap directly on the tiny ‚Äúsend‚Äù word (it‚Äôs not even a button). The message just disappears if you tap anywhere outside of that area. It is a complete waste of time. This overlooked problem is a dealbreaker. Also, you can‚Äôt scrub through received voice messages."
"We just moved a large group from WhatsApp to signal. Initial experience was good. But somehow, after we removed some users as admins and added others, the entire group has become read-only with respect to updates of group name, membership, and any group features. Even admins cannot update any of these. 

We can still send/receive messages. But members cannot leave, we cannot change admins, or change group name ‚Äî all group updates are rejected. The specific error we get is ‚ÄúGroup could not be updated‚Äù with no further details on how to resolve the issue.   I suspect we triggered a bug in the protocol after we removed/added a bunch of users as admins.  

We were joking that now have an extremely secure group ‚Äî members cannot join or leave and no changes allowed! :-) Anyway, I hope Signal gets in touch with us so that we can troubleshoot the bug and get it fixed."
"Read an article today about signal and wanted to see what the hype was about. It‚Äôs almost like the WhatsApp platform. What I would like to see already is the option to change the chat wallpaper, and more options with stickers. I do enjoy customizing my chat and changing things around. My husband and I use this app and trying it out but more options would be nice. For now I am giving this app a three star for what I am currently seeing within the app, maybe when I see updates and more improvements I will come back here and provide another review. Oh before I forget I do like that the messages are encrypted and privacy does play a big part for me and my family and friends. But let‚Äôs just hope the developers will see this review and come up with some brilliant ideas to make this app #1 .... I‚Äôm looking forward to this journey."
"I switched from What‚Äôs App about 9 months ago and never looked back!   The updates continuously improve the App and started financially supporting the dev team once I was hooked.   The emoji message tagging is definite improvement over What‚Äôs App.  If I could recommend one feature to improve it would be the requirement for the desktop version to download the thousands of messages each time it loads.  That seems unnecessary and time waiting but I don‚Äôt pretend to understand the architecture that may require that download.  WA doesn‚Äôt need to do this.   All in All, I prefer Signal over WA for many reasons and I believe the dev team deserves your support to keep the product secure and pure!!"
"How is it privacy focused if it announces to the whole world that you are on signal?

The developer responded ‚Äúit‚Äôs not anonymous‚Äù and suggested their app is only about encryption. On their website, however, the first thing they tout is ‚Äúan unexpected focus on privacy‚Äù.  Still not sure how to square broadcasting your name to every single person on Signal that you might be connected too has anything to do with a ‚Äúfocus on privacy‚Äù. It sounds like the gist is that no one is snooping on your messages, but everyone knows your on there. What‚Äôs silly is that signal thinks it needs to be ‚Äúmore pervasive‚Äù for its concept to work, but with unexpected outting of your privacy it‚Äôs never going to become more pervasive because it sets the tone by undermining your expectations right out of the gate. Signal should stop using the word ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù in its marketing materials and replace it with the word ‚Äúencryption‚Äù because that is all it‚Äôs offering. If you‚Äôre that worried about it, I‚Äôd just use a burner."
"Nickfrikiname is very wrong! This is a great app and I've always promoted the app to my friends. He's upset because of his particular situation. What he failed to understand is, signal really does protect your privacy, from anyone and everyone. Unfortunately in this world we live in privacy seems to be very scarce and signal helps bring that back! I do wish the phone call feature was a tad bit better as far as the recipient being able to hear what I'm saying, but I totally understand that being encrypted can't be a easy task and probably very complex but at least they are trying. Recovering old messages shouldn't be an option and should stay that way no matter what. This is what the app is built around and how they promote it!"
"Signal is great. You configure the settings to your liking & it‚Äôs very private. You can enable face-ID, Thumbprint, & a pin. It allows disappearing messages, & calls, even video calls. The video calls rival FaceTime, which is surprising because I‚Äôve tried many different video call apps, all seem to be sub-par to FaceTime. However, Signal is right there. I wish more were using it so the government can‚Äôt pry at our messages & companies like Facebook & Google can stay out of our conversations. Keeps us away from ad trackers with the combination of the VPN. None of your phone listening to you talking or typing. 

4/5 stars simply because 5/5 makes no sense. People wouldn‚Äôt read the review & I want the company to make it better over time, not get complacent & do no future updates. It can improve in certain areas."
By far the best calling and texting all ever. Whenever I can‚Äôt hear someone on my regular phone due to static or bad connection we go to signal and the connection is flawless. Can hear them clearly and loud. I also love the fact that I‚Äôm in control of who gets what messages for how long. You have the last day so on who gets to keep your conversations. Making it really private private. I also I‚Äôm thrilled with the fact that they are not interested in saving anything on the cloud so whatever u delete is really lost for ever. No way for someone to blackmail u with nothing. The ease of access and user friendliness is also above and beyond expectations. I highly recommend this app to everyone wanting to keep things private and secure.
"Find a better way to save chat history or stop updating the app every time because whenever I update I‚Äôm forced to delete the app and have to redownload it because all functions on the app don‚Äôt work including linking accounts to save my chats. Apparently Signal shuts all functions down when they want you to force update. 

 I have an issue where my phone simultaneously has an old deleted Apple ID that is primarily registered but cannot sign in/remove because it ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt exist anymore‚Äù along with a new Apple ID that I‚Äôm using currently. So whenever I decide to update signal it tells me on the App Store that I‚Äôm ‚ÄúUnable to update‚Äù which makes me force delete signal and redowload again only to find out that all my ALL my chat history has been deleted. This happens everyone you guys decide to force an an update and it‚Äôs totally annoying!!! Other apps do have a better way of saving chats‚Ä¶"
"Better onboarding, yet still all the same problems as before. 

They do great security, but don‚Äôt seem to have privacy as a priority, which is weird.

End to end encrypted, they keep no activity logs, this all sounds great. But you can‚Äôt use the service without giving them your actual phone number - I mean, if I wanted people to have my phone number, why would I need Signal? I‚Äôd just text them.

Then they want access to all your contacts - to tell you who else is on the service, and to tell other people that you‚Äôre there. That sounds like an awful thing to me. And it also begs the question of whether I have the consent of every single person in my contacts on my phone to give out their names, phone numbers, email addresses to someone else. (Hint: I don‚Äôt.)

I think they want to see Signal as some kind of social network, instead of just being a great secure communication platform.

Yo, Signal: I can contact the people I want to communicate with, all by myself. I guarantee you it‚Äôs a much smaller group than the 1000 or so people in my contacts list.

Please: let people sign up without giving up a phone number, and use the app without access to their address book if they want to. ‚ÄúDiscoverability‚Äù is nice for networked printers, but many of us really don‚Äôt want to be looked up. 

Privacy. Just as important as security."
"This app is excellent in terms of offering the best options and services other top-rating apps offer. The only reason why I cannot give 5 stars is that it keeps updating on a weekly basis! I do understand and respect the attempts the developers make to keep the end-to-end encryption and security updated and impenetrable, but is it really necessary to update the app for some mere stickers and unimportant stuff?! Anyone in need of these shenanigans can go find them in any other app! Initially I thought the updates are security-related but once you click on the ‚Äúmore‚Äù option, you realise it‚Äôs not that crucial. Then again, I have tried ignoring the redundant updates and well: the app‚Äôs functionality goes down. Please think about this before you want to download it."
"I really like Signal. It‚Äôs just pretty awful that it notifies people in your phone contacts that you‚Äôve made an account and there didn‚Äôt seem to be an explicit opt out at account setup. I forgot I had the phone number of a man who sexually assaulted me, (didn‚Äôt realize signal would notify everyone) and it was terrifying when Signal still allowed him to send me messages even after I deleted him from my contacts shortly after creating my account. It would be great if there was a way (or at least an easy way for dumb folks like me :P) to opt out of letting Signal notify folks in your contacts that a you created an account.

The bare minimum would be to have an explicit and accessible (no legal jargon that you need college level English comprehension for) warning that Signal will notify people in your contacts on account creation. That would have been better than nothing."
"The last thing we need, is another app selling our personal information to third parties like Facebook enjoys. I've closed my Facebook and will remove my WhatsApp account before uninstalling, in order to not leave any info behind. Social media has become public poison. ‚ÄúFor your own sakes, quit trusting in mere man.‚Äù ‚ÄîIsaiah 2:22

I trust in the God in the Bible, his name is Jehovah and he selected his only begotten Son Christ to restore what we lost when Adam rebelled. This app was chosen to help God's children stay safe. I send my thanks to the developers of this app. Thank you for allowing us to enjoy a private conversation again with our brothers and sisters around the world. God bless your app development team. üôèüíú"
"My friends and I switched to Signal about a year and a half ago. The main reason: pictures and video. Text messages would heavily compress all of the images we would try to send, and any GIFs or Videos we would send to each other would suffer a similar fate. So eventually, we decided to try this messaging app. And after this long, I can firmly state that it‚Äôs one of the best messaging apps that I‚Äôve ever used. 

WhatsApp was out of the running when we wanted to switch away from texting, as was Discord. Neither has the strong security with encryption that Signal demonstrated. 

Signal proved to be the perfect messaging app for us. And since we send so many message and images (and we don‚Äôt want to keep them all) Signal provides the great feature to keep storage space free, and keep our group chat uncluttered. 

Just a few quality-of-life improvements would make this a superb messaging app, such as multi-image or video sending. The current process is arduous with a ‚Äúone image at a time‚Äù approach. Other than that, there really isn‚Äôt much to complain about. 

It works, and it works well."
"There was a mass exodus from WhatsApp early 2021 and it put a strain on signal. It‚Äôs actually labeled the largest migration in tech history. That being said that app is much improved disincentive then. However it still has issues. Poor connectivity and strange app bugs. I notice that sometimes when I hit the close button on my iPhone it‚Äôll disconnect the call for some reason. That is obviously annoying. I‚Äôve filed a bug report and only got an automated response. I will continue to use signal. Knowing it will only improve.
Update: lately the app has been doing a weird thing where the messages don‚Äôt come in until I open the app and send a message to that person. Then a bunch of their messages come in at the same time."
"Such promising functionality and features BUT, alas, I only downloaded this app for security and privacy reasons - only to discover the atypical demand this app makes that I SHARE MY CONTACTS!  That's a hard pass...I will delete this app asap. If I wanted this level of non-privacy, I would have downloaded another disrespecter of privacy like What's App. Boundaries, please!
I have a hard time believing I am an anomoly in expecting a security and privacy oriented app to actually respect privacy (of my contacts in this case). Arrrgh! 
*Reference point for those still considering the merits of this app:  after you download Signal app, the app forces you to ""choose"" to allow it full access to all your contacts. Note the dubious term, ""choose,"" since you are truly given NO CHOICE. You either must allow this or not access use of the app. 
**Addendum: I have this app opportunity to prove worthy of privacy standards: I explored/researched ways to bypass sharing my contacts. I searched via Google search and via Signal's own website. Per indo posted by Signal they DO force you to share your contacts. And no, not all phone or messaging apps do. Google Voice is just one example of communication apps that don't force you to reveal/share your contacts in order to use the app. 

Poorly done, Signal. Privacy violations is a real deal breaker for me!"
"A simple, open-source, cross-platform, feature-replete messaging app with good security practices... I used to think this was an impossibility. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs not.

I‚Äôve convinced a few friends and family members to try it and they like it as well since it‚Äôs stable and works well without requiring complex setup and maintenance like handling (and learning how to properly use and secure) PGP keys.

Furthermore, the audio/video call quality is fantastic! I couldn‚Äôt believe how crisp and clear the audio was when communicating with loved ones overseas using poor to standard Internet connections. Truly phenomenal.

My 2 complaints (hence 4 instead of 5 stars) at the moment are:

1) No native iPad support. It‚Äôs the one mainstream device I and others own that I‚Äôm aware of without native support for Signal.

2) No native sticker support. Yes, this is a superfluous feature for a privacy/security-oriented messaging application, but I think it should be a priority for implementation. More fun features‚Äîlike rich links and GIFs which are already supported in Signal‚Äîwould help entice adopters. iMessage is fun to use because of support for extras like stickers, effects, and other rich media that add extra dimensions to conversations."
"I LOVE the file sharing, it gives iPhone users more versatility and it means I can share lots of neat things with my group.

The ONLY thing I feel is missing is the ability to make polls. It would be awesome if the polls could have their own ‚Äútab‚Äù on the chat too, so they don‚Äôt get lost in the messages like in other apps. Being able to ‚Äúopen‚Äù and ‚Äúclose‚Äù polls and limit the amount of answers would be helpful as well. Also making it so that whoever makes the poll is the only one (besides admins) who can change or add new answer options.

I love this app and will be using this over things like Facebook messenger from here on out. GREAT JOB!!!!"
"Hi! Would like to make a suggestion. Please fix so you can‚Äôt see who changed what on their settings/profile, It is very annoying to see this pop up and notify a group or even an individual, too much notifications. I think it‚Äôs not necessary to know about every contact who changes what, to much notifications especially on group chats. This seems to be the biggest concern / annoying for most that I know of from my contacts . And why doesn‚Äôt the picture profile of a contact zoom in or once click on it it doesn‚Äôt become enlarged? Very new to this app so far I see this the most annoying. Will give more stars once I figure it out more about this app. 
Especially if you change the profile update notifications for all."
"I was looking for a way to communicate securely with my group of friends from college. Signal seemed to be the better choice over Telegram so I went with them and invited over a dozen people to download it as well.

Unfortunately, there seems to be an issue with the group chat functionality where I can‚Äôt add a new member to an existing group and instead have to start a new group chat every time another friend joins and wants to be in the group chat. Attempting to add someone who isn‚Äôt in the group chat results in the message ‚ÄúError. User is already a group member‚Äù

Please fix this bug as that would make this a great alternative to iMessage / messenger etc.‚Äù"
"I do not like the idea of my conversations not being private, at all! I was using WhatsApp until Facebook bought them. Its now uninstalled. I‚Äôve switched to Apple phone and computer and uninstalled Google everything, I don‚Äôt use Waze anymore either and I loved that app.  I use Duck Duck Go as my search engine. Facebook and Google have more information about me that I can bare. This is one more way I can take back a small part of really having privacy. Please don‚Äôt sell out like everyone seems to do. I‚Äôll donate just to keep this app owned by people who are not spying on me, selling my personal information and forming algorithms to learn who I am without my permission or knowledge. Thank you. üòä"
"It‚Äôs very worth taking every conversation you have over to Signal. These big social media apps are doing everything they can to remove user privacy from the situation. It‚Äôs important we recognize that and do everything we can to support those making sure privacy remains an unalienable right.
Signal is a phenomenal app beyond its end-to-end encryption benefit. Even if you are just chatting about skittles and what your favorite cereal is, I think it‚Äôs vital to not send another word through these big tech companies. Just use signal, if you need anymore reassurance, take a look at all the new terms and agreements social media apps are taking this year ü•¥"
"I would give this 5 stars, originally I would give it 6 stars if it were possible, but am now concerned about potential hack ability. Even with end to end encryption, a big selling point here was that everything was stored locally and there was no server access.  Now I can use delete for all.  That means the server has access after the messages have been sent.  

I am also unhappy that I have to give out my phone number.

I am hearing rumors of possible 3rd party products.  And commercialization.  I am willing to PAY for Signal just to keep it free of these.  The more access to the platform others have, the less secure everything becomes.  And no one likes commercials."
"I was very happy to find an app with encryptions and not owned by Facebook. Unfortunately it does not reliably send/receive messages. Daily, I will get a message saying it was just delivered but when I open the app, it was sent 20mins, 1hr, 2hrs before. Often I won‚Äôt get messages from hours ago until I send one out. 
I‚Äôd also like to see the contact name on the screen after I‚Äôve selected them to send an image to. Nobody wants a screenshot or photo accidentally going to the wrong person. 
They also need to improve the desktop app. It loads every message that hasn‚Äôt been cleared and takes a VERY long time. They also need a Chrome desktop app available. 
I do love that it doesn‚Äôt show online statuses...I look forward to going back to this app in the future when it‚Äôs solved a few issues."
"I love everything about Signal EXCEPT the fact you can't remove people from a group chat. My business colleagues and I use Signal mainly for business so when someone is no longer a part of a specific project we're unable to simply remove them from the group chat. You have to create an entirely new chat and add everyone back which is a very annoying process. 

Another thing is when someone calls me from Signal, it doesn't show me whose calling unless I specifically have the Signal app open and am on Signal at the moment. I'm not sure if that varies depending on what type of phone someone is using or not but I have an iPhone 6. It would be nice to address that as well if possible."
"At first it was a little bit hard using the application. Not because it was bad but because I was so use to all the features other messaging applications had. I stick with Signal for the privacy it provided but since the first time I downloaded they constantly update the application and add really useful features and make the app more clean and easy to use. Right now I have almost every friend and family using it because privacy it‚Äôs important and the change and features you are going to left behind over time are less and less.

I really recommend the application! Plus, they actually care about your privacy."
"With every ‚Äúupdate‚Äù I hold my breath hoping the core defects such as frequent loss of connectivity with the server resulting in undelivered messages for many hours will be fixed. Instead I receive more useless features that continue to break the app at deeper levels. The most current update around Jan. 27, 2020, has now given me an app that doesn‚Äôt ring when called through Signal.
It seems as though Signal has sold to a company like Facebook who‚Äôs only interest is to stuff useless features while ignoring basic functionality.
BTW, WhatsApp now sends everything you type to Facebook servers before it sends your ‚Äúencrypted‚Äù message to the recipient.
I can no longer trust Signal as a secure app and neither should you.
It is unlikely you will ever get to see this review as they place very old ones at the top, back when it Was a great and secure app."
"We‚Äôve been needing to split our time between a couple of continents to care for family members. Texting was often tricky, expensive, or utterly failed. Signal has solved all of that. It‚Äôs reliable, works every where and has all of the features we need. Text, audio, and video calls all work very well; video quality was as high or higher than FaceTime. 

Plus it‚Äôs very secure and has NONE of the Facebook shenanigans of collecting and distributing your data. 

The only thing I found tricky at first was adding pictures. Going into pictures first, selecting the ones I want to send, then uploading them to Signal works great."
"Since I start using Signal I realize some things that are missing and hope to see them with the coming updates, most of the time when you close the app and someone sends or calls you and your notifications are on, you cannot know until you open the app, please don‚Äôt tel me that my phone is old or my connection is poor, it should appear in your notification bar that you have a call or message, you cannot know who‚Äôs online and when your last appearance, one more important issue that must be taken into consideration seriously, while having a call the battery loses a huge amount of it in a very short time."
"Signal makes it very clear that privacy and encryption are paramount to their mission. I appreciate that very much. They also host a couple features that I haven‚Äôt seen anywhere else such as reacting to a message with any emoji in the emoji bank, not just the classic 5. Also, in-app customization is something you see here and not many other apps I‚Äôve seen, certainly not the prominent ones. 

I give it 4 because there are a couple features I would still like to see moving forward. One such being the ability to schedule a message. This is a very underrated function that many other apps have at this point, and imagine will see its use become more prominent."
"Switched from Whatapp with the Facebook policy change.  Appreciate the security of Signal.  However I cannot stand that every time I go to have a conversation there are all these rando contact recommendations that I have to manually swipe left to remove.  No way for me to have a ‚Äúhome‚Äù
screen with my chosen contacts or option to stop auto-suggest people!  I will
determine who I want to be in contact with - let me search for their names to see if they are in Signal.  Super annoyed that oz have to use the search feature for people I have added and that I had 57 messages displayed which is just all these rando folks that the app finds.  So when I actually DO get a message from a contact it‚Äôs lost in the noise. PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!"
"Our family chat groups moved from WhatsApp to Signal after all the hullabaloo about Facebook abuse of privacy. I might guess that our group wasn‚Äôt the only ones looking for an alternative to FB-owned group chat. We‚Äôre still using Signal, but we‚Äôre surprised at some basic flaws. You can only share one pic at a time, videos and pics won‚Äôt turn to landscape when you rotate your device. And now with a recent update they‚Äôve added extra steps to see who has viewed your posts/responses. I‚Äôd think that Signal would do everything they could to match and exceed the features and ease-of-use of WhatsApp, but if they are, they‚Äôre being extremely slow to do it. As I said, our family groups are still using it, but not enjoying it as much and as a result our rate of interaction has dropped by a fair amount."
"Absolutely love this app. Acclimating to it from iMessage user‚Äôs is very simple. As it‚Äôs interface is very straight-to. Love the encryption and decryption offered, not that I necessarily need it (being a normal, boring guy), but it is very secure to anyone that may. Like iMessage, you can sync your phone on your computer with the (free) application offered for Mac/PC to send messages at your workspace, without having your phone on you (and once again, the program is very user-friendly). I would recommend Signal to anyone looking for a secure, efficient way to send encrypted texts ~ It‚Äôs replaced the iMessage slot on my phone ~ go ahead and give it a try, you‚Äôll never want to switch back üòâ"
"I recently was a whatsapp user, and was never fond of the fact it is owned by facebook. Next thing you know, there implementing facebook invasive privacy policies. Jump on the app store, I come across signal. And so far I love it, I love that it‚Äôs independent and built off non profit donations. So a big company can NOT buy it out, and everything is private as it should be. No ad based tracking or anything, if your a privacy lover, this is the best app to use. Especially if your talking to someone who does not have access to imessage. Can‚Äôt wait to see what‚Äôs in store for future updates now that it‚Äôs growing wild. Thanks to fb ruining whatsapp."
"First of all, my friends and I all deleted the green bubbled app I won‚Äôt name. We were sick to death of privacy violations & of Facebook. I love the ability on this app to be invisible & the sound is great but other things are still lacking (big time) in comparison. We all want to be on signal and not W.A. & want you to succeed but here are things signs badly needs to fix. All my friends have tested and agree on these things independently:
1) it takes EONS ( and often doesn‚Äôt work) to send videos
2) so many bugs and issues when trying to upload an audio into app vs making it in the app (like uploading from files)
3) anything over a few minutes long takes way too long to send
4) if you send audio or upload media and close app while it‚Äôs sending just by minimizing it it will never send. 
5) in app recording video quality is bad 
6) uploading a video from photos stream to app greatly reduces quality 
7) no ability to rotate a video 

Those are all that we‚Äôve had issues with. Plz improve so W.A. can disappear into oblivion. Sadly they still have a better functioning app. You guys deserve to succeed against them."
"Signal is just AMAZING! Privacy eccentric, dark mode, no lame video statuses, just what it's supposed to do Messaging. It has useful features like dark mode, disabling the typing indicator, disabling notifications doesn't prompt you to enable them back again. For privacy focused people like myself I do not require chat backups so that I can dwell on the conversations I've shared with people and keep them forever happily ever after, I'd happily pass that opportunity. In a future update I'd like to request for a smaller Unanswered Outgoing call 'bubble' in my chat history, as it takes tooo much space. A HUGE shoutout to Open Whisper Systems for creating an application like this. Thank you very much!"
"If you don‚Äôt want to use your phone number, you can purchase a burner phone or use a Google voice number.  The phone number is for verification and is the minimum amount of information needed to setup.  The PIN adds 2FA to your account and also reserves the number you used to set up (especially important if using a burner phone number or Google voice number). You can also install on your tablet and desktop (MacOS, Windows, Linux)

WhatsApp knows and shares contact and group info with Facebook, knowing all of our connections... Telegram is a really great messaging app, but isn‚Äôt encrypted by default."
"Just like everyone else, I jumped into the Signal bandwagon because of Privacy and Security concerns with WhatsApp, the most widely used messaging app. I even convinced all my friends and family to jump as well. 

However, Signal still has a lot to catch up on, feature wise. 

1. Any video calls initiated just shows up as another msg alert and half the time, people miss the alert. It will be very useful, if the phone starts ringing when a video call comes in like it is on WhatsApp   Or at least a more prominent alert type for video calls. 

2. The ‚ÄúAll Media‚Äù section doesn‚Äôt list any audio recordings shared with an individual or group. It only lists pictures and videos. I‚Äôm a part of a band that share a lot of audio ideas with the whole group. It‚Äôs a Herculean task to always scroll through hundreds of messages to locate an audio clip shared in the past. 

But otherwise, the app has a lot of potential and the wind blowing in the direction of other apps that‚Äôs not ‚ÄúWhatsApp‚Äù will likely work in Signal‚Äôs favor. I just hope the devs don‚Äôt get complacent and stop continuous innovation and feature additions."
"I used SIGNAL for years and loved it until recently. With it becoming so popular I was forced to use a different app because Signal is not as private. 

Here‚Äôs my concern and I hope the developers can come up with a plan! I wish we could have the choice to allow what contacts can see that we‚Äôre a Signal user vs those that we don‚Äôt want them to know. For example; opting out on who can see you vs who can not!  Giving the option to let your contacts know,  ‚ÄúHey! I‚Äôm using Signal!‚Äù to ‚ÄúNo! I don‚Äôt want any of my contacts to know I‚Äôm using Signal, with the exception of these contacts‚Äù.

Meaning, WE get to choose who can see us using Signal vs who CANNOT see us! Now that! That is complete privacy! If they would ever program it like that, then I would use this app again, in a heartbeat!!!!"
"The ability to seamlessly move between desktop and mobile is top notch and invaluable. Other than that, the product leaves much to be desired in very basic functionality.

First and foremost, there is no search function to find text within a chat. This would be invaluable in trying to find something mentioned days or weeks or more in the past in a chat.

Second, there is no indication next to members of a chat or individual contacts indicating whether they are active (IE, in the app or at their desktop).

Third, there is no way to get rid of the prominently displayed list on your desktop of all contacts from your mobile that have signal, even if you have never contacted them via signal. And this takes up valuable space on the desktop. Plus there is no way to reorder the annoying list of chats.

Fourth, it‚Äôs great they finally added emojis, but still lacking sounds. Would be nice to have a few sound alert options, at least for the desktop version.

Lastly, though I‚Äôm sure there are others if I thought a bit more, there is very limited ability to resize the chat window on the desktop. It takes up too much space, unless you minimize it completely."
"How can an app that prides itself on privacy be the most non-private app there is? Your phone number is shown to anyone but whats most terrifying of all..... you can SEARCH anyone‚Äôs phone number and it‚Äôll automatically open a chat for you to message them if the number is registered on the app. 

Anyone I might have blocked on my own phone could search my number and be able to contact me, but also know Im using the app. Its a major invasion of privacy for me. I did an experiment and searched a specific person‚Äôs number(someone I dont want to be able to know of my whereabouts) and they had an account! 

Immediately deleting. And I heard that if someone on your contacts makes an account, it notifies you. Terrifying. If someone still has me in their contacts but I dont, they would be notified about me. Nu-uh. Nope. Deleting my account."
"Stop using Facebook‚Äôs evil malware (Messenger and Whatsapp) and switch to software that cares about your privacy. Signal is FOSS and features end-to-end encryption by default. Yes other apps may have higher video quality and some extra features but they are also backed by billion dollar companies that are committed to extracting as much information from their users as possible in order to sell that precious data to the highest bidder. 

We need to rethink the way we use software as a society and the best way to do that is to move on from ‚Äòfree‚Äô ad driven apps and onto programs that work for us and not advertising agencies."
"Signal is 5/5 stars for security, but I use the call/video function often and I would like to see the ability to flip the camera for both you and the other person to landscape mode (similar to current WhatsApp video function). Also, the ability to make either your video screen or the other person‚Äôs video screen big or small (also similar to current WhatsApp video function). A few of my calls failed while using the app. I downloaded Signal because I was looking for a messaging company I can trust, and so far, so good on that front. I really enjoy the simplicity of the application. That being said, there are definitely opportunities for improvement."
"In times where billions of dollars are made from social media platforms where users are the product and where the government records all communications which they can access anytime they feel the need, it‚Äôs nice to have Signal. I don‚Äôt have deep life secrets that I discuss but it‚Äôs the principle of privacy that everyone should have. I don‚Äôt like talking or texting on anything other than signal. Frankly, I don‚Äôt understand why any of us communicate with anything other than signal. I love signal because what you tell someone is no one else‚Äôs business."
"The service Signal runs is excellent for the security-focused. Strong encryption and obsessive data minimization mean that I trust the service, and recommend it to most people I know. Despite this, the app has strange interactions with the rest of the system, a rather unpolished notification system if you have it on multiple devices, a lack of support for the watch, and the inclusion of payments to others only by a coin that probably would become virtually unusable if people actually adopted it (that they don‚Äôt even accept for donations, themselves). If none of these are deal breakers ‚Äî and for me, they aren‚Äôt ‚Äî the app is serviceable and an easy recommend."
"I‚Äôm overseas and communicate mostly Stateside.  I use Viber for speed instead of email. We can text back and forth on the spot, which you can‚Äôt easily do with email.  Yes, it‚Äôs certainly not secure, but reliable with many functions, such as easily being able to delete previously seen and unseen messages to an individual.  Signal is apparently secure, but, in my opinion, has few functions other than security.  I‚Äôm trying to delete older unseen messages, which is easy in Viber, but in Signal, I only get a short flash of options on the screen and I‚Äôm unable to to do anything.  I do donate to several orgs that I use for free, and will do the same with Signal when it‚Äôs more functional."
"Signal is going to need to step up to the plate much quicker. To take over whatsapp, a world wide app, Signal needs to: 1- add ‚Äúonline‚Äù, ‚Äúlast time online‚Äù, options; 2-needs to allow iCloud back ups so that users can switch devices without losing tons of chats; 3-make it so users can change phone numbers on app w/out having to un & reinstall app thus losing everything; 4-allow option of media sent & received to be saved to phone automatically.
If Signal doesn‚Äôt step up quick, people are going to ignorantly not care that FB is stealing ALL of users media & contacts for free to misuse.
How can users help Signal speed all of this up? I‚Äôd pay a fee..."
"I am no longer getting notifications while I am playing music.. the music pauses for about 1sec then goes right back to playing... no sounds... it only seems to happen while I am using a BT speaker (not fully tested yet) is this a new security measure??

The latest update is a huge help for me, I keep my contacts separated by ring tones so that has improved it for me.. I do wish it could read the contact info and get ringtone, and bypass from there.... would simplify settings for multiple contacts...
Slowly but surely getting better... next update I would like to see is the ability to change colors of conversations..."
"Firstly, I‚Äôd have done the decent thing, and contacted the developers of this app via other channels than a less than happy review, but the so-called support site associated with this app is very scripted, and discourages users from contacting anyone directly. So, this is the only other avenue left open to me.

This app used to work very well with voiceover, as of about 6 versions ago by now, you can no-longer lock the record button without voiceover going entirely silent, thus making control of the app, sending whatever you‚Äôve recorded, etc, a moot point. While this app has the best sound quality around, QA as of late is in the toilet... Please fix your voiceover issues, and I‚Äôll move my 1 star rating upward accordingly. I realize I‚Äôm just one person, and that eye-candy and stickers are more advantageous right now, but seriously??? 

Color me singularly unimpressed..."
"Since the idea of this messaging app is about privacy, I find that there is a little bit of conflict when it comes to group chats. Not everyone wants their contact information on display to a bunch of strangers. If there was some kind of option where everyone‚Äôs info (their phone number) is hidden by default in group chats then that would be amazing! With an option to turn it on would be even better. This would be helpful when I‚Äôm wanting to broadcast a message to a bunch of people without also inadvertently giving their contact information to a bunch of strangers. 

Other than that, great app!"
"Even the simple task of adding a user to contacts does not properly work.  Did the developers even try out the app themselves? After you click on a user, select settings, and try to add them to an existing contact, what if you want to cancel? There is currently no way to do this other than close the App! Second, if the user is already in your address book or contacts and then that user joins Signal, it‚Äôs  weird that the app still do not say that user is in my contacts. Anyway, when I try to add this user to my contacts (where he or she does exist) the process fails so many time with no feedback! I‚Äôm sorry to ask but did you even test this app?

Right now when people are in dire need of apps like Signal, it is frustrating and irresponsible to release such a buggy app and drive users away.

I hope the developers fix the issues soon."
"Update: back up and running smoothly! Thank you for the quick response from the Signal team. Definitely the best alternative to WhatsApp. Glad to see it‚Äôs continued growth. 

Original: App worked well for a few days and now I can‚Äôt send out messages. Same for all my iPhone-using family members. We all have different models too including an 11 and still can‚Äôt send anything out. Troubleshooting page wasn‚Äôt helpful. Want to give the app the benefit of the doubt and say it‚Äôs overwhelmed by the influx of new users but can someone help us? And then I‚Äôll write a legit review."
"I myself was an early adapter to signal. Since their roll out the changes made are phenomenal!! Security, privacy, and trustworthy! Far more than I can say for many other apps out there. Bells and whistles I wish not for as it leaves room for error. As it stands now I have reliability, trust, privacy. On an iPhone regular calls are sort of muffled, on signal the clarity is outstanding! The support team is quick to respond to any issue with fast and friendly and supremely knowledgeable support. Can‚Äôt ask for much more than the brains and support of the signal team!! If I could rate higher I would!! By far the best app out!"
"My friends and I moved to your platform for privacy and we love that you keep adding in new capabilities to keep up with more established messaging clients from Apple and Google.  

But I‚Äôm baffled by the latest release.  I love the fresh design (Signal has always felt very dated) but the density of information in the new release makes it so much harder to pay attention to the content of messages, particularly in high volume groups.  Why do I need so many icons and information for who has read and how long ago it was posted? On every single message? And why is the author in the left column and at the top of every text? And why does all of this metadata have the same visual prominence as the content of messages?

It‚Äôs honestly so disruptive that, despite our love of Signal and privacy and the barriers to switching, we keep bringing it up.  We love you Signal, but this was an enormous fail."
"I used to use this app for everything. I made all my friends get it because I loved the interface and the promise of privacy. But, recently things have gone sour. After a recent update, all the calls I‚Äôve made have failed after less than 10 minutes. The connection is constantly terrible and the quality has dropped tremendously. The amount of issues I‚Äôve had with this app recently has nearly prompted me to search for a new platform. If any of the developers see this, please look into the problem. It‚Äôs ruined my experience with the app which has until now been overwhelmingly positive."
"I just wish that it could be faster and if the massage is taking longer to arrive cuz of bad network I don‚Äôt want to see the buffering motion it just gives me anxiety you could replace it with nothing I don‚Äôt wanna keep looking at it moving until finally the massage arrives even if it only take less than a second its still annoying .
And i also feel that typing is slow the letters don‚Äôt follow my fast fingers so its better to make it faster also when am typing with another language other than English I can‚Äôt see the space when i leave it its hard to tell if i typed a space or not other than that the app is good"
"Hey guys. Really happy to use your app and thankful that an app finally respects our privacy. 
If I can just advice you. Have a look at WhatsApp and add some features please. Like everyone is saying it isn‚Äôt comfortable to tact on it cause we‚Äôre used to have plenty of backgrounds on WhatsApp so we can change it. It‚Äôs better with colors and everything. Signal is either all white or all black according to the mode your iPhone uses. 
I think more people will move to signal if you guys update it. Just out the same features as WhatsApp and you‚Äôll see your users growing faster. 
Thank you."
"I wanted to like this app, but after switching phones and realizing that I‚Äôd lose all of my message history made this app a complete no-go for me. WhatsApp has many more features and has an option to backup messages to iCloud (I‚Äôm aware this may defeat the point of security, but I attempt to keep that account as secure as possible). WhatsApp also has more granular features such as stats, settings, more options for saving media, and a full desktop app while Signal relies on a Chrome extension. 

If this app offered a way to export/import conversations on iOS and more options to handle media like adding a feature to auto save to camera roll or a gallery feature, I would consider returning."
This app is extremely easy and useful as it should be. Privacy and simplicity are here! This is awesome! Allows you full usability just from a Wifi connection.. no active carrier network needed to call or text.. and either party can set disappearing messages time line.. from ‚Äúimmediately‚Äù after opening up to a day.. or not at all. This app doesn‚Äôt require you to give access to all your private data to sale your information.. you pick what you allow access to and how you choose to share. The most used app on my phone and ipad.
"Signal is definitely top drawer.  It‚Äôs nearly the only app anyone with sense ought to use to communicate.  Or was.  There is now an open source alternative with email account signup named Wire, based on Signal.  Wire is far more user friendly, less prone to release issues (take a look at the awful Signal desktop clients).  And Wire has all the pretty gewgaws which your recalcitrant friends like to see in a chat app.  Signal still relies too much on Contacts.  And the iOS app doesn‚Äôt verify well, nor allow much in the way of dropping phone numbers.  

Signal is still the standard.  After all, it‚Äôs endorsed by whistleblowers who put their neck on the block.  Get Signal.  Use Signal.  Anything but the awful faux privacy protections of FB and such.

But the issues which once only annoyed in Signal are now starting to pile up as faults.  They are starting to bring in fixes, which is a good sign, but one wonders at the stubbornness of the founder dev against things such as federation.

As well, there is STILL no iPad version.  Please, for the love of Heaven, throw an iPad UI out there!  It‚Äôs bizarre."
"Signal is what our family uses for all of its instant communications. Might not be as full featured as something like Keybase, but is a heck of a lot easier to use - easy enough for me to foist on my mother (at the same time, she's more tech savvy than 99% of grandmothers). We went with Signal because of the numerous third party recommendations as to the strength of its end-to-end encryption. Been using it for years now - it has been solid and does exactly what we need. Sure, some things like desktop integration could be better, but using it on the phone is the most common use case, and it works perfectly for that."
"I have used this messenger when I was slumming at foogle. As a newbie in Apple and suffering from cultural shock, adjustments and knowing Apple has restrictions on apps, I hope to see gifs and stickers due to a strong need for them. Not all of us can express ourselves using just typed words. Not all of us can spend typing words due to arthritis, lupus or other degenerate diseases. There are others with cognitive difficulties using pics/gif/stickers as a fast message to love ones is the best choice. And there are others who send stickers to love ones which the receiver equates it to a $10 Hallmark card. An excellent messager is very important and will provide different and up to date options for most everyone."
"I primarily use iMessage but for the alternative to those not on iOS, Signal is the only way to go. Facebook will mine and sell your data with WhatsApp and Telegram though uses good encryption, their servers on kept in Russia who is the Facebook of governments. If WhatsApp wasn‚Äôt owned by Facebook, WhatsApp would be the choice but since that‚Äôs never changing, it‚Äôs time to move on. Signal doesn‚Äôt collect any info, they continue to build features and improve the user experience. There is no business model. Investors believe in privacy and are paying to give it to all. Make the Signal."
"I used to give this 5 starts, but I'm very concerned about the new focus on fancy mainstream features vs. the former ""privacy first"". Stickers are cool and all that, but it stops being funny when privacy/security tradeoffs are being made elsewhere.

Instead, the development time should be spent on finding frictionless ways of explaining (while using the app) WHY certain features seem less convenient than in non-privacy respecting messengers. This could be via popups, short educational videos, etc. and it needs to be compelling and ready to understand.

While this requiressome UX/UI wizardry, it would be a real service to our society. So many people would finally get it. (And power users could just turn the ""educational mode"" off.)"
"I am baffled to see such high number of 5 star ratings with such poor user experience. I have a suspicion that these folks are just happy to see another end to end encrypted messaging app where their friends are.

Apart from a seemingly flawed implementation of end to end encryption, following are my high level usability issues with the app which is making me not feel like using this app:

1. Text editing does not conform to the phone OS‚Äôs style. Apparently Signal decide to implement their own inferior UX. 

2. Message options (long press on a sent or received message) are placed counter intuitive. I don‚Äôt understand the need of showing myriad of emojis next to the message instead of message editing menu.

3. Many a times I do have a person in my contacts, and Signal app says not. I tried to add the person in my contact and alas ‚Äúcreates a duplicate entry for SAME phone number.

The app needs to be more finished like others out there. The only reason I leave two stars is the simplicity in design, easier for elder crowd to use this app and somewhat acceptable end to end encryption in the app."
"I downloaded the Signal app because of whatsapp‚Äôs new privacy update. I set it up so that it does not access my contact list. I later tried to send a txt to my brother directly from Signal. I looked up his name in my contacts and found that my contacts were wiped from my phone. I lost all my contacts. My I cloud account had only some old numbers. My other devices don‚Äôt have my updated numbers. Even Apple is unable to reset my contacts. I believe the app stole my contacts. My husband allowed the app to access his contacts and it works fine for him. I tried re downloading the app but, it skipped all the introduction steps since it remembered me. I just wanted to share my story as a cautionary tale for those of you you are thinking about switching to signal.  I guess privacy nuts like me are out luck! üòñ"
"These folks are Top of My Kindness and Professional List .. They go far and Above beyond the call of (Any Team I have seen in many many years )  They all deserve the Metal of Honor as far as I can see! I am stunned by their caring and concern for others‚Ä¶ Being a Military Brat I totally understand Service to our Country, My Father gave 25+yrs to OurUS Navy and I was by his side and we all took care of each other no matter of rank or circumstance these  unbelievable folks are with out a doubt some of the most caring people on this Gods green earth and I‚Äôm honored beyond words to express my gratitude üôèüèª and heartfelt thanks to be among such Heros !"
Half  of the coolest features like the disappearing chat timer or  ‚Äúhidden between app switcher ‚Äú don‚Äôt work. I have an iPhone X bruh I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs not a device issue. I‚Äôve tried a few different ways to figure out the timer but they are always there.  The recurring pin was annoying but I think I figured out how to turn off the reminders. In the case you really don‚Äôt want someone else looking through your buddies phone. It really doesn‚Äôt secure anything. If they have that phone number and can connect it to a personal contact list you‚Äôre immediately exposed. Idk why it shows phone numbers so openly of the point is security. just the name on display is fine.
"[DEV TEAM]: I have to send photos through the Photos app b/c I can‚Äôt select any from within Signal. I have the higher privacy setting for photo sharing (select on per app basis). It used to work acceptably but now I can‚Äôt select any. ‚Äî OK, I went to Settings and select none. Opened the app and it offered to open settings when I tried to add a photo to a group chat. I selected some photos. Now I‚Äôm back. But please move the ‚Äúselect more photos‚Äù option to ABOVE the already selected photos and not at the far right end of selected photos. Otherwise it takes too long to scroll."
"When this app first came out, it was nice just to have some peace of mind. However, there was much to be desired for a messaging app. The current version has come leaps and bounds. I especially appreciate being able to set different text tones for different contacts, or to be able to change notification settings. And being able to use the desktop version alongside has been wonderful. The formatting could be a little bit better, I would like to change the text size. But I am still giving it five stars, because there is no other apps out there I trust more."
"Facebook and Instagram were the only social messaging apps that I used. Then 2020 happened. I am thankful there is another option for staying in touch and for sharing news stories, videos, memes, etc., that seem to offend Facebook and Instagram and it‚Äôs fake fact checkers. Oh, and there isn‚Äôt some politically driven ‚Äúinformation banners‚Äù on my Posts and my contacts posts! 
I am thankful for a place that I can share with family and friends and not need to worry about my privacy being invaded or told what I can message/post or can not! 
So, thank you! üòÅ"
"Downloaded Signal and they lost me using it on the part where they notify all my contacts that I am on signal. I‚Äôm not sure why so many people put faith in this app. WhatsApp and Viber are both end to end encrypted, just as this app except they don‚Äôt notify all of your contacts. Whatsapp snoops in your messages, calls etc for advertising. Signal is in the US which means they can and will give up your information if the US deems it wants it. Viber is in the US as well, but evades taxes using other countries addresses (which tells me they are not required to give the US our information if they want it). I‚Äôll be using Viber until something better comes along."
"First, I‚Äôm grateful that Signal listened to their user-base and made the PIN/cloud backup optional. So I‚Äôve changed my review from 1 star to 4 stars. I can‚Äôt give that 5th star (even though the app is excellent) because they tried to force user data into the cloud, and the users had to fight for their privacy. I‚Äôll be honest, I‚Äôm nervous the company will try to force something like that again. Their user demographic has a huge percentage of people who are willing to forego some convenience (and the security of backups) for the sake of privacy. I really hope they don‚Äôt forget that."
"Calls between iPads and iPhones suffer from portrait/landscape issues. The only way video calls work is for both parties to use portrait, which is awkward for an iPad. This issue also crops up when the two parties are using different orientations on a phone.

Other than that this is a solid messaging app, a good alternative to the non-private and questionably secure alternatives. It is my primary messaging app, and I have moved most of my circle to it, including some not very tech savvy people without issue.

Could use some more features like being able to migrate phone numbers"
Previous review includes a lot of speculation. I have zero affiliation with these guys and happy with product. In fact I love it. The ability to move anything to my laptop securely and back and forth is pretty great. If it moves in a commercial direction I‚Äôll be done but right now super happy. Stupid silly things like a quick icon move  you to to the last text. Such an obvious feature that imessenger doesn‚Äôt have as far I know. If Im wrong please tell me. Drives me nuts. Bottom line for me is that it‚Äôs a great way for me to talk privately and move private documents back and forth is fantastic
"The only thing I would like to see have added, if it‚Äôs at all possible, is like the stock messaging app, when driving mode is turned on (or while it‚Äôs on), it would beable to send an auto-reply message to let the sender sending a message know the person their sending a message to is driving now/currently, this option/feature can be disabled by default and can be enabled/turned on by the user, but it would be nice if it could be added to that if wanted/needed, can let the person know why their not responding right away.

Thanks!"
"When I installed it everything was perfect, now I can‚Äôt send any messages. I tried on wi-fi, I‚Äôve tried without it, restarted the phone and few other things and still nothing. I love the feel and the look of it, but they need to fix the bugs.

On January 20, 2021, I was contacted by the developer (something I really I appreciate) and was told that the day I wrote the original review Signal was experiencing technical difficulties. And is true, by the next day everything was perfect and it‚Äôs been performing beautifully ever since. I highly recommend this app."
"The idea that this is a secure and private app is severely untrue. I got the app to talk safely with a friend. I found out that without notifying me (in fact, after assuring me in the install that all my info would stay private and secure), Signal spammed a bunch of people, some of whom I had blocked because they were very unsafe, with my number and a big heads up that I was on Signal and available. I found out too late I‚Äôm definitely not the only one who‚Äôs been compromised by Signal, and there is no way to turn this off. Cannot say more strongly - STAY AWAY from Signal. An app that puts itself out as a safe place and then proceeds to expose and put in danger people who use it is absurdly appalling. Would give zero stars if I could. Absolutely unacceptable."
"This app is advertised as private. That‚Äôs what drew me to it. I‚Äôm tired of big tech making money off of me.
The reason for my review, however, is Signal‚Äôs versatility and capability.
I can view Signal on my mobile devices as well as my Windows 10 computers (one at work and one at home) and my Linux Mint computer. Wherever I am, Signal is just a click away.
Signal allows me to attach many different types of files to my messages. I can even send large videos via Signal without sending links to Dropbox which typically confuse the recipients.
I can make ‚ÄúFaceTime‚Äù calls with Signal. I can make phone calls too, with stunning clarity.
So, I am enjoying this app. A few friends have switched over to Signal after I sent them links. Everyone was wondering what my suggestions were all about; why I felt the need to try to improve their communication experiences - UNTIL they downloaded it and tried it! 
Everyone should have this app!"
"The app is short sweet and to the point. I personally would like to see more features to personalize the experience such as the ability to change the name of group chats, individually so each user can call the group a different name on their personal device. I use it for work so I can‚Äôt change the long names that they put but I would like to so that I can quickly identify similar names chats without offending my bosses. Also, admin rights would be cool so that only designated people can change the entire groups formatting, such as profile pic, name, and people invited/uninvited. I would also enjoy a feature that pins or favorites more used chats at the top of the page so you can easily find them. Overall, the app is good, but I need more personalization and organization features."
"ive been an early signal user, back when it felt like it was just a few security and privacy geeks into this stuff. but im so happy with the adoption and the constant feature rollout these guys have made.  in my mind, the stickers + reactions were the game changer that got my friends off of FB Messenger for good. and now the group video chats? perfect! my only feedback would be to increase the seamlessness between calls on desktop app vs mobile, pick up can get buggy at times. also, make group chats even more seamless."
"1.) It‚Äôs impossible to disable the annoying send sound without putting phone on silent. Even if I choose ‚Äúnone‚Äù for the sound, it still makes it. Why the heck is that the default?

2.) You can‚Äôt permanently ignore a chat. Even if you archive and mute, you‚Äôll still see latest messages from the chat. Facebook messenger figured out how to do that, why can‚Äôt Signal?

These don‚Äôt seem like difficult problems to fix. I don‚Äôt need video or any fancy features. Just a messaging platform that can do the basic things right. And this can‚Äôt."
"Hello! I love Signal. The only thing that it is missing a bit lacking, is like the ability to go back to a certain point in a conversation. Like in WhatsApp there‚Äôs an option to ‚Äústar‚Äù important messages and in Signal, there‚Äôs no such option. If I have an important conversation with someone and need to go back to a specific point in the convo, I have to scroll for a long time trying to find the message. Would love your app a lot more if you considered adding a ‚Äústar‚Äù option. 
Thanks so much!"
"I would suggest typing bubbles. Idk if it goes with the privacy thing why they‚Äôre aren‚Äôt, but the messaging in the app looks & sounds like iMsg and has read receipts so I don‚Äôt see why not. It would always be super insightful and helpful. Maybe add them and add a feature where they can be seen or not to stay true to the private and secure component. Also, the voice recorder is DATED. There has been a plethora of times where I have recorded long voice memos saying important stuff & it disappears cus I have to keep my finger down/ If I don‚Äôt slide correctly up then it‚Äôll cancel. That‚Äôs super annoying. Other than that this is the app for privacy. I‚Äôm telling ya."
"This has been happening ever since I recently installed it again. Been trying to find an alternative to Whatsapp, and the Great Facebook Outage yesterday finally gave me and my significant other / work team the push to make the switch.

I don't receive any push notifications when the app is backgrounded nor closed. Only when I enter the app does it send them. This is infuriating, as I have to be constantly jumping in and out of Signal to make sure I don't miss any important messages. 

The team over at Signal LLC have claimed to fix said issue, yet it persists even on this latest update. I've tried checking notification settings, re-registering notifications via Signal, I've tried rebooting my device, tried reinstalling yet the problem persists. 

I really don't like the idea of having to be forced to switch applications yet AGAIN due to such a minor yet fatal flaw, but will be the case at the end of this week if a solution isn't found. 

I appreciate your read and the time you've taken out of your day to read this. Stay safe."
"These last couple of builds since about 5.21.x have a couple of very annoying bugs that seriously affect usability:

1. Long pressing a chat bubble to get access to the sharing actions, opens the new context pane (for thumbs up, forward, reply, etc. actions) for about a half second and then goes away on its own, so you can‚Äôt make a selection.  VERY ANNOYING!!!

2. If search finds more than one hit, the results pane incorrectly shows multiple copies of only the first found text, E.g. if searching for ‚Äúsignal broken‚Äù produces 2 results, the results would show ‚Äúsignal broken, yes, that‚Äôs true‚Äù twice, instead of ‚Äúsignal broken, yes, that‚Äôs true‚Äù, and ‚Äúsignal broken, will never be fixed again‚Äù."
"Hi team, I have been using Signal for a long time however recently after WhatsApp has announced update about privacy I am among those who backed off from it and more users have been switching toSignal. I would like to share some feedback from user who still loved to stay with WhatsApp due to a feature that users still stick around with it i.e., having option to post photos as ‚ÄòStatus‚Äô so that all the contacts can be shared with latest ongoing. I think adding this feature in Signal could benefit and attract more users to join Signal."
"When my wife traveled to Hong Kong recently this was the only way that we could guarantee our communications were private and secure. Several times we had to exchange information about her financial accounts, and I did not want anyone eavesdropping. We could also make phone calls over Signal when she had a Wi-Fi connection and it worked flawlessly.

I have used Signal with my clients as well so we can exchange private and secure communications (like their credentials for company servers!). 

All of the top cyber security folks I follow swear by Signal. It‚Äôs a great app and a great service."
"No kidding, this is the first review I‚Äôve ever written. I‚Äôll just say I love this app because there‚Äôs no upper limit, or if there is I haven‚Äôt reached it yet, on how many folks you can put on a group chat. Maybe I‚Äôm just non that popular, lol. Makes life easier when you you have to communicate with a large group and you have people with devices other than apple. Again, maybe I‚Äôm ignorant, but when I try a group message on iMessage and there are others with Samsung devices etc, the message won‚Äôt send on WiFi.  Signal works like a charm."
"Signal is a reliable, straightforward, and unobtrusive messenger. Of free messaging apps as of August 2018, it's the best tradeoff (in features) for the security of encrypted communications and open-source coding. 
More than anything, I'd like to be able to flip the screen orientation (even at the expense of screen size), so that I could use it comfortably with my keyboard. Either being able to share the account between my iPhone and iPad, or being able to silence notifications of certain individuals within groups (so I don't get notified on my iPad account every time I message someone in a group including my iPhone account) would also be huge."
"I‚Äôve been using Signal for a couple of years now and it‚Äôs a great piece of software! I use it whenever possible to communicate and it‚Äôs been easy for my less cryptographically inclined friends to pick up. 

One wish I had is that I could use it on my iPhone and iPad at the same time, just like I can use it on my iPhone and desktop at the same time. I do most of my surfing and social stuff on the iPad and save the desktop for heavy lifting. Usually my phone only comes out when I leave the house so I miss Signal messages regularly.

Thank you for making this!"
"Absolutely love the app & all that it stands for. I‚Äôve been having issues with it lately on iPhone 11 that I don‚Äôt have on galaxyS8. Camera will often stop responding when trying to snap a photo from inside a message in signal. Will either return an error or just go black. 

Also, when listening to Google Play Music, if sending messages or anything where audio could be involved, all audio from Google Play Music cuts off until manually turned back on. When turned back on, pitch is somehow made higher. Unknown if signal or google issue, but it only occurs when signal is used. 

Thanks for your amazing work."
"Sadly we‚Äôre not happy with the way ‚Äúbig tech‚Äù is treating most Americans.  It‚Äôs just not right to silence freedom of speech. I‚Äôm old enough and have seen too much personally to keep silent about anything that‚Äôs on my mind.  I suppose old habits die hard.  With that said, I consider myself a liberal thinker, ie ‚Äúlive & let live.‚Äù Now,  I‚Äôve taken my liberty to join Signal.  It‚Äôs truly fantastic!  Fast, easy to use and most importantly private. Thank you to the developers of Signal for remembering how important and sacred the right to free speech is and what patriotism means."
"End to end open source encryption with minimal records retained by the app provider; that's as private & secure as a person can reasonably get. After a month I'm satisfied with messages, voice & video calls but can't comment on sending texts while calling or group chats as other reviewers have mentioned; haven't tried those yet. Seamless communications among multiple devices might be convenient but I'll give up that minor bit for better security. Convenience versus privacy seems an unavoidable choice for cross-device synch. Keep improving, Signal üòé"
Switched over from WhatsApp. This app does not settle merely as a WhatsApp ‚Äúreplacement‚Äù but it also has features that surpasses WhatsApp. Signal is made with love (you can see it in how they labor over it while remaining a nonprofit) and with a singular vision of making a great messaging app with privacy at its core. Having the backing of the original creator of WhatsApp and people like Elon Musk gives me confidence that Signal will continue to be improved while keeping true to it‚Äôs values. Many features already added in the last 2 months.
"Good messenger w decent features

but needs a better notification system. There are several quirks that make it annoying. (like receiving a notification for each message even from the same person when you open your phone, and it continues to annoyingly pop up even when you're doing something else or in the process of checking the message)

id rather have the option of just having a notification at the top of the phone or on the app shortcut itself - short of muting the entire convo, these are not options on iphone"
"I attend a lot of concerts. And with large crowds, cell phone towers are under high demand and stress, which makes their networks slow or unusable (especially deprioritized MVNOs like Cricket). I was recent at a show at which I had two bars on my signal indicator. My iMessages could not be received or delivered, but my messages on Signal came and went without any issues or delays.  It made is so I could located the people I attended the show with when we got separated."
"I would strongly recommend using Signal because of how secure and private it is! 

Developers, would be nice if you could please include a feature that backs-up chats to the cloud versus needing a new device to transfer messages. If some one needs to reinstall iOS for any reason but doesn‚Äôt have a new device the chats will be erased at the time of the reinstallation, but if there was a cloud feature messages would be safely stored in the cloud. Thank you for your hard work and dedication! You guys are awesome!"
I use messaging apps rathe than SMS so that I am NOT tied to my phone.  I want it to work across devices equally well.  The thing I hated about WhatsApp and still hate about Signal is the tie to a mobile phone number?  Why?  Who cares?  Now you can just use a temporary number it only needs it once to set up (so far) but then there‚Äôs the even more annoying thing that some essential functionality doesn‚Äôt work on the desktop.  I give it five stars because it works well in general and is secure and non-profit.  I wish they would ditch the cell phone tie in.
"I, like many, downloaded this app because a bunch of my contacts deleted WhatsApp. I immediately noticed some layout things, that really bother me as a long-time WhatsApp user. 
1) there are no dividing lines between threads 
2) on group chats, it does not show who the message is from when you are on the thread view. You have to go into the chat to see who wrote the message which I do not always want to do if I want to keep it unread

Both of these are things i have gotten used to from WhatsApp and it would be awesome if they could be resolved. Until then I will not enjoy using this app as much."
"Signal is a fantastic app. Love, love the safety and security. Love the lack of ads. I‚Äôve been using it for four years or so and try to convert anyone I am texting to this platform. 

My only complaint is that lately it has gotten really, really difficult to navigate through an unsent message to edit the text. When I hold the space bar (I‚Äôm an iOS /iPhone user) to move the cursor somewhere in the text to make corrections, it gets all wonky and the screen flashes and the cursor goes all the way to the top or the bottom of the message. Sometimes I cut the message out, paste it into a note, edit it, then paste it back into Signal to send. That‚Äôs a lot of unnecessary hooplah. I had hoped this update would fix that, but no luck so far. 

Also, would be REALLY great if it could send a notification to my Apple Watch that a new msg has arrived - not who or what the msg is. Just that I need to check my phone. 

Thanks for an app I really love."
"This was the gold standard for private communications for years. Then they added the optional ability to have it look through your contacts for convenience blah blah. But you could say no. Now, you are forced. They require access to your contacts. That just isn‚Äôt right in an app that was made to be the best privacy you can get - one that claims to provide end to end encryption good enough that they can‚Äôt read your messages. I believe this last claim, but in light of the requirement to take your contacts, I‚Äôm not sure why. Inertia, I guess. Signal: REMOVE THIS REQUIREMENT!"
"Let me just say that I love this app--absolutely love it. The app could just use some adjustment in terms of weblink texts. For instance, I use the group messenger, and I like to link the WSJ article, and unfortunately, I can't connect through the paywall, even though I am a paying subscriber. This is something I could do on a regular text messenger, and I would love to see it on this app.
Another thing with the linking. It would be great if pictures/videos were visible on links. I would definitely donate to see this accomplished and overall, I am very happy with this app."
"Soooo I came from another crypto app and I switched because their servers were to slow. Signal seems super fast. And they seem secure. I only wish they had a second layer of security when the app opens, just like banks or other security focused apps. I want a passcode just for this app. As of right now all I can tell is they rely on the phone being locked. If it‚Äôs not and someone opens the app they can access and see all your signal messages. Maybe I kiss d something but that seems like a GIANT oversight. It‚Äôs a. Ice to have that they hide in the app switcher but a passcode or login on the actual app is needed."
"I don‚Äôt know which update changed this, but I used to be able to use signal on 2 or 3 devices (mobile, desktop, laptop) and not get bombarded with copies of the same messages each time I opened it. Meaning, if I read a message on my phone, it ‚Äúread‚Äù on my laptop and desktop too and didn‚Äôt flood me with banners and notifications. Now, when I open every device, it overwhelms me with banners and notifications of messages I‚Äôve already seen. There‚Äôs no option to turn this off that doesn‚Äôt affect user experience in other ways. I really hope this gets fixed."
"Making the reactions panel harder to reach, isolating the message from context, and forcing the extra options that used to take up the bottom of the screen to now take up half of the middle is just a bad design change. Seriously why is it that long pressing a message which used to open the quick reacts right under your thumb now opens them 1.5 million miles away?

Whoever made these changes either doesn‚Äôt use reactions so they shouldn‚Äôt be working on them, or doesn‚Äôt use signal so they shouldn‚Äôt be working on UX/I for the app.  

Don‚Äôt try and fix what isn‚Äôt broken."
"cause I can stay in contact with friends for free who do not have imessage!

A friend of mine told me about it a couple of months ago, so I did some research on the app and when I learnt who is behind it and that it is secure, I downloaded it and set it up in less than 2 minutes.

Quite a few of my friends switched to it now, too ... we love to send photos which sometimes takes a little bit of time to load (this is a difference to imessage which works faster) but this is the only criticism I have."
"My son suggested Signal a couple of years ago and I love it. I tell everyone I know about it. I refuse to use other messengers if I can help it. Now to get my European friends to come over to the Signal side. Because the other messenger is not What‚Äôs happening for me. üòâ I feel like I‚Äôm in one of my dreams when I use it. You know, the ones where you go out in public and forget your clothes? Yes, exactly, EXPOSED! So join Signal and keep yourself covered!! Unless you are at a clothing optional spa and then that‚Äôs up to you."
"Two versions ago Signal for iphone had a simple and elegant process for attaching photos to messages. Then they messed it up by making it much more complicated, particularly if you wanted to change or delete a selection. For the latest version they have made ohoto attach almost impossible. No matter how careful you are, by the time you have scrolled through yiur photos looking for the one you want, you will find that you‚Äôve accidentally selected several others you don‚Äôt want ‚Äî and the only way out is to delete and start over.  A classic case of upgrades making a program less and less user friendly"
"This is an app that regards your privacy highly. 
The messages are supposed to be secure , the highest possible security so I understand no back up. 
If you are planning to use this as an app that will archive your life or your family. Then don‚Äôt , it‚Äôs not secure if one requires this. 
The person who posted a one star review should have understood the app properly and served to WA or IG That way they can have a back up and so can all the people at FB. 
This program is dope cause it‚Äôs not like all the others. Also I own my content at all times and it‚Äôs private"
"I like that signal is easy to use and highly secure. I live in the Middle East and security is a big issue for us here. I wish, however, there were admin rights. I also wish you could also remove people from groups. This poses a security risk for us, as any time people lose their phone or get a new number, we have to start new groups. We cannot risk that someone‚Äôs old number might get recycled and someone not a part of our groups gets access. It‚Äôs a pain when we have nearly 100 people in some of our groups."
"Signal is great. This last update added a bunch of stuff I‚Äôve been wanting for the last couple years of use. 

That said selection of photos is completely broken for me. I get the new pop up every time asking me if I want to select more. Click yes and I‚Äôm dumped back into chat with no photo selection. 

Then when I go into the view to swap between apps the selection window pops up. It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs popping up behind the chat window and never allowing me access. Literally the only way I can get photos into the app because of this is leaving the app, finding the photo in my photos app, copy it, return to signal and the chat in question. and then paste it in. 

So it‚Äôs awesome I finally got pinned messages a thing I‚Äôve wanted for almost two years now. I just wish it didn‚Äôt come at the expense of no longer being able to hit the plus button and drop photos into chat."
"I love using signal! It's fast, simple, and I don't mind potentially using free WiFi (even though I have unlimited data). I really like the dark (night) mode that can be toggled in the settings. However, is there any way it could be set to turn on/off with the sunset/ sunrise? And if that would be too difficult could I potentially set a schedule for it to turn on/ off to? I know it isn't super hard to toggle, and I don't really mind doing it manually, but it would be really nice having it on a schedule or with the sun. Thanks Signal team!"
"To Brian Acton,
I never liked Facebook inc or anything by that company. Recently I have been digging into the deceived world of Big Tech. I have been trying to tell people about what‚Äôs happening. I learned about this big tech problems from other people but I realized no one was doing anything about it. It starts with people, people like us you and me. I am pledging to donate money out of my paycheck to you guys every month. 
Brian Please don‚Äôt change, keep doing what you doing I‚Äôd love to meet you one day I‚Äôd be my honor. 
Thank you."
"Signal is the real MVP of all the messaging apps. Not only are your communications encrypted, no NSA peeping toms, but they collect zero information from you. Unlike all the others like WhatsApp, Facebook messenger, google hangouts, which collect everything they can to data mine you, build profiles about you and resell the information without your explicit consent. Stop supporting these privacy thieves and get al your people to move to signal. Shout out to the signal non profit and to the devs who make an awesome app."
"Issues: 
1) I can‚Äôt use alert tones I've purchased, and only one of the ones offered is friendly to my senses (bamboo).
2) I switched from WhatsApp, and the things I‚Äôve missed, Signal has largely covered (for example, threaded replies and swipe to reply), but I still really miss being able to star (ie, bookmark) messages. I miss being able to view just the starred messages, and I miss being able to delete all but starred messages. Any chance we can get a similar feature, Dev?
3) Gifs have been integrated, but there‚Äôs no way to stop a gif from repeating endlessly. I really need a gif-stop function. 

It‚Äôs nice that it now allows you to delete the app without losing all your info and that it periodically asks you to reenter your retrieval passcode so you don‚Äôt forget. 

I also really like that we can react with literally any emoji. Now if we could get a search bar in the emoji react menu...that would be awesome."
"I don‚Äôt see why this would happen, and I‚Äôve done everything necessary to try and fix the issue on my own, including using the signal trouble shooting reccommendations, reinstall the app, restart my phone, etc.. But, when the Stickers update was installed recently, I now have issues with the app connecting under WIFI and it won‚Äôt send or receive messages when it‚Äôs connected. I‚Äôve also checked my internet, and it works fine with every other app on my phone, even my laptop and my family‚Äôs phones. The app does not want to connect to my phone, and I hope it gets fixed.. until then, my data is going to suffer."
"I switched to signal from WhatsApp months ago, but it still needs the following:

‚Ä¢ The ability to share voice notes outside of the app (you can only forward within the app or reply to them)
‚Ä¢ Reply messages need to flash when taping on them (when you have stacked voice notes, its hard to identify which specific message the person is replying to. The desktop version of Signal has this feature.)
‚Ä¢ Allow consecutive messages to play without having to manually play them"
"I rely upon this indispensable app. I receive consistent value from Signal; today I was moved to make my first donation. Im also considering joining Signal‚Äôs beta program. In my experience, Signal has been reliable; truly a 5-star app. 

In this spirit of gratitude, I and several users around me would deeply appreciate support for Apple Watch OS 6. We‚Äôre looking specifically for complication support showing the unread messages count, similar to how Apple‚Äôs Messages app complication behaves. We would like to see this complication deployed for each available watch face; this way older version Watch OS users with limited faces and current version Watch OS users with newest faces can still use the complication.

I appreciate Signal‚Äôs excellent and ongoing support; I and other users around me would love to see Apple Watch support with live complications. I recommend this world class app.

Cheers,

Christopher"
"Come on, Signal!!  Give us user IDs already instead of requiring phone numbers!  If Session messenger, a fork of Signal, can do it, so can you!!

I wish it didn‚Äôt require disclosing my phone number and the phone numbers of my contacts in order to function. Phone numbers can be used to identify people by name, although Signal claims they hash phone numbers and don‚Äôt have access to actual phone numbers. I‚Äôm still hoping that some day they implement an alternative method that doesn‚Äôt require providing ANY personal information. Until then, I‚Äôll stick to alternatives like Wickr and Threema. Signal is the best choice if you don‚Äôt mind giving out your phone number."
"The interface is a little hard to get used to but now I feel comfortable. I‚Äôm phasing out of ‚ÄéWhatsApp and will delete it for my phone soon ‚Äî never to be installed again!!!

I still use iMessage because most of my friends have not switched to Signal‚Ä¶ but the migration is clearly happening‚Ä¶ I feel safe and secure on Signal. I use a iMessage for friends and family‚Ä¶ And signal for EVERYTHING else.

Signal is a gift to the Internet ‚Äî keep it open source, keep it free, keep it secure, use Mozilla as your mentor!"
"I‚Äôve been using Signal for at least 6 months now, and it‚Äôs incredibly private, super easy to use (basically just like texting), and while it‚Äôs free it ALSO works fast? Amazing. The only hiccup i‚Äôve seen time and again, is whenever I try to answer a call from another user it will say ‚Äúcalled ended‚Äù or ‚Äúsignal lost‚Äù. It‚Äôll take us going back and forth for about 4-5 minutes just for one of us to answer. Very frustrating, but for it being the only problem for me, it‚Äôs well worth it!"
"I started using Signal for my group messages at work. But since it combined so much of what I prefer about all the other messaging apps into one, it‚Äôs pretty much the only app I use for messaging now. 

If I had to make a suggestion, I have one practical one, and one convenient one. 

Practical: I would love to have a way to download my old messages to a new device. The last time I had to switch phones I lost all my previous messages and files when I signed back in to the app. That was a while ago, so this may have been done already and I‚Äôm not aware of it. 

Convenient: Being able to edit the default Reaction Emojis would be awesome. I know there‚Äôs like a ‚Äúrecently used‚Äù section, but when I‚Äôm in a hurry, having my ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù come up automatically would be great! (I know‚Ä¶ first world problems‚Ä¶)

Thanks!"
"After the WhatsApp scandal, I transferred the whole family to Signal in order to maintain our privacy. I am so happy I did so. The UI is so straight forward and so pleasing to me I have falling in love with the app. My family is loving the transition and we don‚Äôt even miss WhatsApp anymore. Make the change and take back your privacy! I hope Signal never changes it‚Äôs privacy policies! My family and I are glad there are still companies out there that still value privacy!"
"I am a sincere hater of messenger and Facebook.  I never liked WhatsApp 

Pros: I can communicate with all my friends in cyber security business . 

I can choose how the notifications appear

I can call my Signal friends were there is zero signal. Westfjords of Iceland proofed that indefinitely

I can send multiple pictures and files in one msg and the voice messages are sounds good 

I can choose when messages disappear or are hided

The app doesn't stay active in other devices unless I use it regularly

Cons

I don't like the feature to see when some of my contacts join signal 

I would prefer being able to choose between my personal phone number or other choices

I wish the pin feature would work. Its useless as it is.  I can put in my pin now and then but if I don't it doesn't matter. There is no security feature in the pin."
"Great experience overall!! Would like it to add more features and the ability to personalize more the app, I‚Äôd like the ability to migrate what‚Äôs app chats directly into signal. Also, when receiving calls and the phone is locked it does not ring and the screen remains off, the phone only vibrates, so there is no way to know when you are receiving a call. I have given all permissions to the app, not sure if it is my phone or is it the way the app is supposed to behave."
"I normally ‚ù§Ô∏è this app. But now it won‚Äôt connect to the internet. Right in the middle of a conversation it‚Äôs stopped sending messages.  I was receiving them but couldn‚Äôt send them.  So I uninstalled and reinstalled. And now it says it won‚Äôt connect to the internet at all; not on WiFi or cellular internet.  Everything else on my phone that needs internet is working except this. I downloaded the app over the internet but the app, once opened, says I‚Äôm not connected to the internet.  Very frustrating.  If it starts working again I‚Äôll edit the stars since it‚Äôs usually great.   But it‚Äôs not great when it‚Äôs not working at all."
"I love Signal and use it all the time, but I really wish I could disable the calling feature. I have accidentally hit the call button on several occasions and the application doesn't ask the user to confirm they want to make a call. So, it just goes ahead and starts calling people and then I have to cancel the call and send a message stating I didn't mean to try and call.

It would be great if I could simply disable this feature I don't want or at least be asked to confirm I want to make a call."
"This has been a long time coming, which is ludicrous that the functionality issues and extreme underlying bugs haven‚Äôt been fixed till now. I have had this issue for months and totally stopped using the app because it was terrible.

The app doesn‚Äôt let me see any groups I‚Äôm on and wouldn‚Äôt let me create a group. This way I can‚Äôt see information being shared and this has gone on for too long. I‚Äôd sent a complaint that wasn‚Äôt even acknowledged. Very poor all round.

Would wonder what would happen to their insistence on privacy standards in the long run if they can‚Äôt keep common tech standards. It‚Äôs obvious it‚Äôs glaring pretense and just strategically used to poach users."
"I had been thinking about leaving WhatsApp for the longest time, however, I was very much afraid of moving forward because the app had become essential in my daily communication with my distinct circles. With the new authoritative decision to force people to share or leave I had no other option but to look for another reliable alternative. SIGNAL! It is great and has all the functionalities I am a accustomed to! Privacy is enhanced and encryptions end-to-end. 

No more WhatsApp ever again!"
"I never leave reviews because I either forget or am too lazy, but this one deserves it. This is an amazing app. I didn‚Äôt know it even existed until a few days ago. Just had my first phone conversation using the app, and it was just as clear as the calls I take without Signal. The one thing I ask is don‚Äôt give in to the ‚Äúchildren‚Äù who want stupid, trivial stuff like what Messenger or WhatsApp could give them. Keep this one clean and streamlined, and you‚Äôll have a faithful following for life."
"Update: 
Performance is better with a new phone of course. I still think this app needs simpler text entry options & (secure) party line calling... A simple reply has gotten way too complicated. Simplify the text entry. I don‚Äôt need a camera button in 3 places. 

With the latest version 3.10, it‚Äôs impossible to copy a link without preview. Link previews can be dangerous! At least give the ability to disable previews in settings. 

My original review is below: 
I've had this app for a few years now.  While mostly it works great and has solid privacy features, there are a lot of unnecessary features that complicate and make it run slow on my phone (iPhone 5s). Also, video chat often causes the connection to fail.  IMHO, it should be smart enough to notice too many dropped packets and revert to audio-only on calls.  If they could streamline the GUI features and help it to run with less memory, less bandwidth, that would really help."
"Excellent app. Keeping the people under our care safe in Afghanistan. And we badly need to 1) pin more than 4 conversations/groups 2) sort the order of those 3) have an option for a condensed view mode

Also it‚Äôs crazy that we can disappearing messages but we can have selective disappearing message. I don‚Äôt want everything to disappear‚Äî that looks super suspicious to an interrogator, it also looks suspicious if there are a bunch of ‚Äúmessage deleted‚Äù notes in a conversation."
"New update disables the option of copying received links. Instead it automatically opens links in phone‚Äôs default browser. This is not a  feature it‚Äôs a bug. 

Privacy conscious users use multiple browsers for different purposes. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre using Signal. Please give users back the option to copy links to clipboard without automatically opening link in default browser."
"I use Telegram, What‚Äôs App and Signal for ‚Äúcivilian secure texting.‚Äù  I personally find Signal the least user friendly, but it is still reliable. I would rely upon Signal if the other two systems were to become compromised or inoperable.  On Telegram a person can go back and edit a message already sent.  On Telegram a person can delete a message already sent.  There are some Interesting software issues when loading Signal on desktop but the photos always go through."
"I have notifications set up properly, yet I often miss calls and texts because Signal won‚Äôt always signal that I have a call or text coming in, and it also doesn‚Äôt always even show a red number to indicate texts or calls have come in, so I have to manually check regularly. 

Another annoyance, for no explicable reason, when I call and turn on speaker phone, the first ring is loud enough to hear through the speaker but all subsequent rings are not, and so I have to press my ear to the phone to hear if it‚Äôs ringing.

And then reception can be really bad, so calls get dropped a lot, whereas calls via regular phone or WhatsApp do not."
"Love open source security. I just wish the interface was a little more useable flexible and readable. Sometimes I want to be able to read incoming texts on the homescreen at a glance and this isn‚Äôt possible as an option. The view of text feels - bloated and bubbles too large compared to telegram‚Äôs readability. Of course, I could just go create my own interface, thanks to open source, so I guess I have no one to blame but the gods of time who have given me so little. Just wished I loved using the interface the way I do with Telegram, which is more focused on user experience."
"for privacy reasons this app is great. the only problem that i‚Äôve been having since I have started using it has been that the messages don‚Äôt always get to the person i‚Äôm talking to when I sent the message, vice versa, I won‚Äôt receive messages either. I thought after the update I wouldn‚Äôt have this problem but just two days ago I received a message 3 hours after the person had sent it, and you can see when they actually sent the message too so it‚Äôs even more frustrating when the main problem is exactly what is necessary for the app to be successful."
Signal has been an amazing messaging app! Its has all the features that you would look for in other applications like instagram and facebook all tied into one. The only complaint that I have is that it doesnt have the features or the automatic feature to mirror your front camera. As a result of this you will spend a lot of time flipping live photos that you are sending and having to deal with the fact that that option does not exist for video.
"I don‚Äôt give any app access to my full photo library. Signal has no mechanism for managing the photos it‚Äôs been given permission to see. For an app that is built around privacy, it‚Äôs really unthinkable that it‚Äôs been almost a year since iOS 14 came out (with this feature) and there‚Äôs still no way to allow access to additional photos from inside the app. Leaving the app, finding Signal within Settings, and adding photos there is unreasonable. It‚Äôs also unreasonable to expect me to allow Signal access to my entire library."
"I‚Äôve been using Signal for over 3 years.
It‚Äôs good in security and they‚Äôve improved a lot in the last year.
What is still rusty and really needs some upgrade is the audio and videos response. When I receive an audio, it gets slow or glitchy; can‚Äôt fast-forward or rewind the videos or audio smoothly (most of the time have to exit conversation and press play again). Can‚Äôt export the media in batch. Not to mention the big lag when making a call, no matter the connection (of 4G or hi speed wifi), I always have to use other app to call."
"I like knowing my info is encrypted end to end in case I am discussing being out of town or sensitive financial/account/password info, etc. Texts and photos are secure, and the VoIP calls are crystal clear and saved me when I had no regular phone service upon arrival at the airport during a business trip to Germany. Airport WiFi and Signal gave me a channel to call my wife in the U.S. and get help when the rental car company wouldn‚Äôt honor my pre-purchased insurance.  Give it a try and invite friends to join to see how it works for you."
"I was put onto this service by friends in both law enforcement and the special operations community. Operator‚Äôs downrange (I was straight leg, light infantry‚Äîcaptain, not SF) who want to have private conversations without being monitored by the chain of command use Signal. The local sheriffs department (where I have a friend that is a major) also uses the app. That‚Äôs good enough for me. Don‚Äôt believe when someone tells you that the app is compromised by NSA/FBI etc. that‚Äôs DISINFORMATION. They can crack it‚Ä¶ but ONLY on an individual basis."
"I like this app and have been using it to replace Skype whenever possible. I really appreciate the emphasis on privacy.
My only real issues with it are:
1) It can only be used on one mobile device at a time and switching between devices is not trivial.
2) The emojis are, in my opinion, far inferior to those in Skype. I realize this is pretty inconsequential but we used to have fun with the Skype emojis and these just don‚Äôt do much for us.
All in all, this is a very useful app and I recommend it. It has improved a lot in the time it‚Äôs been out and I hope the developers keep up the good work."
"This thing is so secure! It is like a secret message written in invisible ink on magician‚Äôs flash paper! Good luck with that b:tches!!!

It sends messages. To people you send them to and only them. If they get it, hooray! You can delete those messages from both/all devices, most of the time‚Ä¶ some of the times. I‚Äôve seen it. You can even call someone using the app. If for some reason you don‚Äôt want to just use your regular built in phone app‚Ä¶ it works."
"I am really happy to switch from WhatsApp tonSignal. I feel better having conversations and sending links/data/info without the concern of having it tracked. It took a while for me to do the switch, but I should have just done it earlier! Update your WhatsApp status to let contacts know you‚Äôve switched to Signal if they need to reach you. Delete WhatsApp. Install Signal. Simple. If this company truly sticks to their privacy policy, that will be amazing!"
"I would easily give Signal 5 stars, but I can‚Äôt with this show generic file icon for files with excessively large dimensions. Signal development team: can you PLEASE let me decide if I want to allow these files to show up in my text feed through some sort of setting??? My bf and I use this app daily and now everything he sends me, I have to save to my camera roll to view and doesn‚Äôt show up in my All Media list anymore! Not happy with this update without giving me the option to override it. üòíüòíüòí"
"Update* The latest app update does seem to fix the memory issues, app is working much better. Thanks. 

Previous Review* This app seems to use so much of the phone‚Äôs memory that the phone closes out all other apps which means you can‚Äôt really multitask because once you open signal all other apps have to open from start again, it‚Äôs really frustrating to respond to a signal message then jump back to previous app only to have it completely reboot. This app needs some serious optimization."
"Today globally WA , FB, Instagram all are down and out! And this platform cam to immediate rescue. I tried and found one can migrate it very easily without any difficulties. It appears similar to Messenger Platform though, it hardly matters as long as chats calls are encrypted both ways! 
Good job done Signal I appreciate the simplicity and basic needs of being in touch remains the fulcrum point of this platform! 

I am sure slowly this will gain the popularity over the time and people shall migrate!"
"Hi the app looks cool, can tou please add the feature so that the user can have option to copy a text or video or images in the chat window and should be able to paste it back in same chat or different chat, this is missing from

Also please make some changes so that User can see their own and someone‚Äôs profile picture in large mode and not just in small circle.

Thank you!"
"I have recommended all my friends to join signal considering all the privacy issue with other messengers. But Signal seriously need to fix their software to run basic features like calling/receiving . I'm not asking for much here. They have the issue that if someone calls me I don‚Äôt receive it because the app never rings. I keep missing all my calls. This is some basic stuff for messenger, Signal team. I would really like to use this app as my default messenger but you aren‚Äôt making my life easier with these issues. Hope your team fixes it soon."
"Signal appears to just work. Once registered to your phone number, Signal connects easily to other people who also have Signal installed. It doesn‚Äôt have stickers, or take pictures, or send money, but it appears to communicate securely in a text fashion similar to the early iterations of Apple‚Äôs Messages. My main suggestion for improvement would be to make the text box auto-size as you enter text; it seems to be fixed in size, and when entering a long message you can only see the last couple lines of a few words."
"The app isn't bad just like any other messaging app but these things should definitely be included:

1. Add the time for each message when it was sent and also a read receipt for when the last read message was read
2. A like option for any message or picture 
3. A way to view all the pictures/media in like a gallery or a list view (rather than have to scroll through the entire conversation to find a picture), along with the ability to swipe between pictures
4. A way to select multiple messages to delete certain ones within the chat
5. Add gifs and other new text features other than just emojis

I got most of these ideas from other apps like groupme and WhatsApp which have most of these features. If signal had these features it would be just as good as those apps. Otherwise not a bad app."
Tried many encrypted apps and this is by far the best ones like what‚Äôs app is Facebook and they actually keep information on you do ur research signal is the only one truly private!! If I had a complaint it would be an option to show the exact time stamps of msgs but it does tell u for instance ‚Äú33 minutes ago‚Äù after 24 hours it tells u the time but other then that it‚Äôs amazing and easy to use u can even erase msgs on other people‚Äôs phones if u want
"After the 2nd to last update, I began to have a problem with Signal. When I keyword search a word, it shows all the results as the same thing instead of what they are individually (but when you click on it, it shows what it really says & not the same message repeated). I wish I could attach a picture to help better explain. But I wasn‚Äôt having that issue before the 2nd to last update. If someone could tell me how I can fix this, that would be great."
"Would like to make a request/suggestion for features: 
1) I'd love to see the exact times that messages were sent rather than how long ago they were sent (e.g. ""11h"", ""9h""), either by displaying them by default (like WhatsApp) or by swiping messages to the left to reveal timestamps hidden on the side (like in iMessages). 
2) I'd like to see a call log in the app too, since I don't see any Signal calls in my phone's history."
"I like the fact that the app is clean no cluttering like telegram with all the channels and stuff. It's purely for private messaging and I use it to talk to my brother who resides in china however these days I'm having difficulty reaching him. Texts that I sent arrive to him like days after and the same goes for texts from him.
I don't get it. Somehow the Chinese government is able to censor your app?? 
It's a very nice app and hope you can find a way around this.

Thank you!"
App is amazing and does what they state it does and protects you and whomever you are talking to from data mining and eavesdropping. The ONLY knock I have is that my battery life draws down like crazy on my iPhone 12 Pro. When checking the battery usage it states that the Signal‚Äôs App Audio is my number one user at an astonishing 71%. Considering I only use Signal for 2-2.5 hours a day total to talk to my fianc√© in another country thats very hefty portion of my battery life. Please address this and I‚Äôd give you guys 10 stars if I could!
"Still haven‚Äôt fixed messages not sending.‚ÄîJanuary 2021-good grief..this still isn‚Äôt fixed. The circle with the check mark only shows up as a spinning circle. IF it shows up as sent it can take longer than 30 minutes. IF sent the normal circle with the check mark will show up. I thought if it was delivered 2 circles with check marks showed up. That does NOT happen quickly, if at all. I just installed the latest update and it didn‚Äôt help. Still says messages failed.ü§¨-3/7/22‚Äìsame to similar crap going on. Support just blames the reception on the person you‚Äôre sending messages to."
"Honestly, I had my doubt about this app.  But after using it for a few months.  I can say I love it. It can do everything text or iMessage can do And then more.  The secure ssl end to end that is claimed is a added bonus.  I have still yet to test it to see if it is actually secure and to end. But a second review will come out on that.   As for the company, the claim is that they only store your access time.  I don‚Äôt think I can test that."
"When I saw the ultimatum WhatsApp sent out, I made up my mind to dump it and I will convince my family and friends to do the same!!! I‚Äôm glad I found Signal and I‚Äôve been getting friends and my family to make the switch!!! The big tech media have to know that this is America....land of the free!!! This is NOT China where they think they can shove this down our throats!!! Dump WhatsApp , Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google, and all evil big tech companies!!! Show them we don‚Äôt need them! They need us! Standup America! Thank you Signal!!!"
"I use the app a ton. However it has a lot of basic performance issues. It will slow to a crawl after a few hours of usage and needs to be manually killed and restarted.

It also should support the iOS share system. An iPad app would also be fantastic (could use the same multi-factor approval process as used by Chrome app).

In general it seems to be improving though so hopefully these issues can be dealt with. My advice to the developers would be to focus on the basic performance issues and the glitches before adding fancy features."
"I used Whatsapp from the very beginning until the last updates etc... it was hard to move and move the family/friends to signal. 
Great app but everyone is complaining why we cannot save multiple pictures at once to photos app or autodownload option there for selected groups etc. We can delete multiple pictures at once but why cannot save? 
Thanks for the great app otherwise."
"I‚Äôve been using this for a couple of years and it is my go to for secure communication. The constant updates let me know the devs are not sitting on their hands which makes me (perhaps naively) feel even more secure. 
If this was a paid app...I‚Äôd totally purchase it. That it‚Äôs free is mind boggling. 

My only gripe (and it‚Äôs not much of one) is I‚Äôd like to be able to put this on my iPad AND my iPhone. But when I‚Äôve tried that it won‚Äôt let me have it active on two devices. Maybe I‚Äôm doing something wrong? I dunno."
"This is the only App that enemy countries cannot hack and that US govt officials are safe using. Not sure why everyone is not using it. Just needs a couple of upgrades:  We usually cannot hear the phone ring when a call comes in, so I miss most calls, until I happen to see the message. Also, I hope they improve the ability to cut and paste other messages into Signal. Other than that, it has been a lifesaver. Literally. Thank you."
"I would really like to see an option to require password, fingerprint, or faceID in order to access the app. If I hand my phone to someone to allow them to use it briefly I would like to know they can‚Äôt pop into Signal and read my messages. Notes has a feature where secondary access security can be enabled for private notes. This should be a no-brainer to add and would give me greater trust in my private conversations being private. Thanks."
"Absolutely love Signal, I‚Äôve been using it for years and try to get more friends and family to migrate away from insecure messaging. As a cyber security professional, Signal is essential in my private life. As more and more people are slowly moving toward privacy friendly messaging and it‚Äôs great to see people moving over.

Keep up the great work!

The one thing I‚Äôd like to see is a version for the Apple Watch so I don‚Äôt need to have my phone with me at all times to send/receive messages on the go."
"These Signaleers write some tongue in cheek funny descriptions for their updates that always get a laugh out of me but they are serious as a charge of espionage brought wrongly against a whistle blower and just as solemnly earnest when it comes to E2Ex3 security to make sure privacy remains a protected human right so that one day we will no longer fear keeping photo albums dedicated to the multifarious ways, shapes and colors of hairy ball sacs, or lint filled navels, or the rainbow of colors intrinsic to winter nose snotgoblins. Or whatever else y‚Äôall must clearly be hiding."
"The most important problem is that there was a point I didn't upgrade it, and it stopped telling me I had new messages. I had to be toldvia text that I was missing an important group conversation, on a group chat I checked several times a week. Suddenly there were no notifications so o didn't check. 

The second issue is that it was (at least in older versions) difficult to copy text to Quito m quote what someone said in a response. 

Thanks for the great work"
"Can‚Äôt complain with this app. It does exactly what you need it to do, and until now I‚Äôve been running it on all my devices. I just bought an iPad Pro and the iOS version of Signal seems to be made just for iPhones because the app needs to be blown up and turned pixelated and letterboxed for it to work properly. It also seems to have problems detecting the iPad‚Äôs orientation when I have it opened out with a keyboard. If you can update the UI for iPad this will be a perfect app and I‚Äôll change the review to 5 stars. Please!"
This is effectively the de facto standard for individual direct communications. Call and message connections occasionally/rarely has outage or reliability issues. Software quality is decent. Generally the service and quality lag behind WhatsApp but general values of the nonprofit especially around privacy make this hands down the preferred app. I plan to begin donating and refer all my WhatsApp contacts here.
I am one of those who left the market leader in exodus recently (January) and joined Signal with lot of hope. I only use Signal‚Äôs basic features to send messages & make video/audio calls abroad. Message delivery is not instantaneous and the receiver can hardly hear the call. I had to call them on the regular phone and ask them to come on Signal to take my call! Even then the transmission is choppy and fuzzy. The issue is not with the internet connection at either end as other apps work just fine. I hoped that the quality will improve over the past 5 months but didn‚Äôt see any. Any plans?
