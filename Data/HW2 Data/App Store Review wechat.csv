"hopefully this may be helpful to some people, i downloaded this app last year and i was able to sign up, i made a new account and everything was fine, until a few days later when i wanted to open the app, it said that i got blocked and i needed to have someone else to help me unblock my account, so basically i did, and i tried it with 5 different people, and none of them worked, i deleted the app and re-downloaded but nothing happened, and my account was gone just like that, i was extremely devastated because i have friends on wechat and thats the only app i can communicate with the through, so basically my number was blocked from that app for whatever pathetic reason; in the end i had to actually change my phone number and i made a new account and it worked, and ever since then i never got blocked, im still using it today and im writing this so that whoever is confused may find this useful. i don’t hate the app, in fact i like it, its just that i was really bummed out on why they blocked my previous number for no reason; also don’t forget you can change your wechat language to english, if you don’t know lol, you can change it from your settings too :-)"
"It’s literally the best social media app I’ve used!! 

Some features I love: message and post translation, deviralization of posts, levels of privacy settings of your posts, invisibility of your comments and likes of your friends’ posts from their friends who you aren’t friends with which also makes your posts’ like counts visible to only you, making stickers with your own pics or vids, easy voice message usage, really high quality video calls (much better than messengers). 

Most of the low ratings say their accounts got blocked. Actually, the reason of its tough security is that it has many functionalities, such as credit card deposit, wire transfer, scan payment... For those who get blocked: 1. You could set up security accounts (in advance!) so that those friends can easily verify for you; 2. Sometimes you need to have your friends sent verification codes to your wechat, which never failed on me once, so I’m not sure why some reviews couldn’t figure it out; 3. Sometimes it makes you choose your actual wechat friends from a bunch of random accounts which is really easy."
"WeChat is a great all in one social media app, it receives updates often. I have used it since 2016 and I am part of very large group chats (200+) and a group that spans too much. 
   WeChat has everything you could possibly need Ex. Calling a taxi (in China), ordering food (in China), Video games, calls, chatting, and it even basically has Tik Tok inside it. 
    Though it does have some downsides if you manage big groups it is nearly impossible to manage because of the lack of features that other competitors like Discord has. Things that competitors have that WeChat doesn’t include: slow mode, bans, sub chats, more roles, restrictions, etc. 
   Overall it’s a great app that still has much to improve on, I will continue to use it since it is how I connect to all of my school friends and family."
"WeChat has permanently blocked my account due to a “suspicious login” which is “in serious violation” of their terms of use. I am a user in the USA and haven’t used my account for a couple of years now. I live 14 miles away from where I last used my account and tried logging on today. The app was downloaded via iOS App Store obviously and it even gave me the option of resetting my password. The password reset email was in Chinese! I changed my password anyway and tried logging in to the app. All of a sudden, it says I’m permanently blocked! This is ridiculous. You send a help request and nobody answers. And then when you try to unblock yourself, it tells you you’ve tried too many time. I can’t even have a friend verify my account, yet so can make a NEW WeChat. If someone has violated the terms of use, why should they be allowed to have another account? More importantly, what term of use did I violate? Not using the app for three years? I don’t have a VPN on my phone, I used the office iOS app. I feel like they just don’t want users from the USA. I did nothing wrong! I just want someone to tell me what I did to have my account blocked and to unlock it since it has been WRONGFULLY blocked."
"This Apps registration requirement is just mind boggling? I have NO problem whatsoever providing a phone number like so many Apps need nowadays...usually you give your number to a trustworthy developer to verify your a real person and they file with the other thousands of users Ph numbers and thats it, no big deal. But for “We Chat” they actually require you to some how randomly contact another user, who is a COMPLETE stranger from who knows were, and ask them to help you finish the registration process? Are you out of your minds? Your crazy and it blows my mind to think other users gave there actual Ph number to a total stranger who could be a hacker...a identity thief...convicted felon....killer...rapist or even worse? HOW CAN THEY EXPECT YOU TO DO SOMETHING SO DANGEROUS for such a common App that doesnt even look that promising or special? Its just SO wreckless and unacceptable and to know that there is even 1 person out that complied is by far 1 person to many? And if something does go wrong and a user is harmed in ANY way, WeChat developers should be be most definitely held responsible for causing it.....NO APP IS WORTH PUTTING YOURSELF IN HARMS WAY PEOPLE? WOW?"
"I have been using this app since 2012, and it reconnected me with my friends from middle school, family members I weren’t able to talk to for years.   I can send messages or do video calls.  Wechat has been the only thing connecting the two continents, and I’m truly grateful.  I will probably lose connection with my dying grandparents and many lasting friendships, but I chose to love and not hate.  I am thankful for the times I got to see my distant family face to face, and I truly pray that there will be alternative ways for me to stay in touch these friends and family members - because for immigrates, it is a lonely world which westerners can not understand.  I thank all Chinese immigrants for your sacrifice."
"I have friends that live in various parts of the world and I loved using this app to communicate with them. I went on a trip to visit said friends, resulting in no need for use of the app since I was there, in person with them. My account goes inactive since I wasn’t using it for a few weeks and when I come back to sign on, it gives me an error message saying my account may have been “hijacked” or disabled for inactivity and I have to get another user to unblock my account. It gives me instructions on how the friend can unblock me so I find an alternative way to communicate with them to do so, but when they follow the given steps, it does not work. I have submitted multiple support tickets for MONTHS for help resolving this and no one has gotten back to me. Not even a confirmation email that the ticket was received. The only reason I don’t trash this app is that I have important information in the messages that I’d at least like to get back to. If I should ever get any freaking help. Horrible service."
"Each time they update a new version, not only any malfunctions do not fixed, it’s performance gets worse! Please stop developing and kill this app forever! - There’s no syncing whatsoever. I must work with this app because of my job. And I have it on my Cellphone and laptop. If I receive and open a message on my phone, next time I open it on my laptop, it won’t be there. Despite that I activated the sync button! And when I’m working on my laptop, and chat with someone, the app on my cellphone shows all my messages as new messages! - And don’t get me start with file system. To see a glance of how an app could be garbage, try to open it. Each time It takes like three attempts or more to open the app. And it’s not like the 3rd time it will open nice and easy. I must wait like 30 seconds to pass the opening page and the like another 30 seconds or more to loading!!! Please kill it and let the people use a real app!"
"This app is awesome, and there’s nothing wrong with it. You can play almost all the games in the world on it, talk to your friends and family, as well as call them. You can also use it like PayPal, and you can post a lot thing so all of your friends can see. I know a lot of the reviews are saying their account was blocked for no reason, but that’s not true. You might’ve been blocked for saying something that’s political related in China or something. They keep a closer watch on those people who doesn’t have chinese phone numbers. Or sometimes they block your account when they see that you have a different phone number that’s not from China. I hope this helps you guys. :D"
"I used wechat for two years. I didn’t use it very often. Most of time I read those messages in some groups. I didn’t post anything on my board. And it asked me to enter my password again because previous login expired. I didn’t enter the right one at the first time. Second time I typed the right password. Guess what? My account was blocked. Only once wrong password caused that my account was blocked due to suspicious login. And I’m on the same devise and same ip as usual. And the problem is I don’t have friends who used wechat over six months, no one can helps me unblock my account. And it requires not only a person to help you unblock your account and people who help you must use wechat over 6 months and didn’t unblock for others for a month.
It’s really ridiculous. And no one answered my phone when I called customer service numbers. If you solved the problem, I will change my rate and review."
"WeChat helps connect people from all over the world, most commonly Chinese Americans to their homeland. We already face a lot of racism and xenophobia so imagine the biggest app that connect us to our family from somewhere else in the world, gone. And look at all the racists here giving it a one star (someone really called the WeChat app developers “zipper heads”)🤦‍♀️ super disappointed and sad as an Asian American. We will never be accepted here and Trump has made that clear since the start of his Presidency and even more within these past few months. And non Asians here have done the same. To all my Asians, please stay safe and let’s try our best to stay positive"
"Not all of my subscriptions are equally pressing for me to read, so now I have this cumbersome extra step of having to click on the dropdown menu in order to get to the old view of my subscriptions in order to see which ones I currently want to look at. Maybe the subscriptions message folder is useful for some people, but now it just makes me not want to use subscriptions. At least make it optional, or give us the choice of whether to view the old view or the messages view first please.

As for the new interface it is way too white, and there is not enough contrast. The update says it’s supposed to be more intuitive and easier to use but now it’s actually harder to navigate because of the color scheme used for all the sections. Also, there is so much wasted space in the margins around messages and text, and everything looks so spaced out (not condensed) which is frustrating. DO NOT UPDATE."
"This is my first app review. I am not writing to rate the app. It doesn’t need it anymore. It will be removed from the store tomorrow, according to the news. Wechat is the place for me to keep connected to my Chinese friends overseas and back home. Now all of us are forced to look for other apps as alternatives. None has been found to be equivalent to Wechat. COV-19 has already created difficulties in physically visiting China. Will we be able to resume normal Sino-US travel soon? I don’t know. Now the virtual connection will be affected with Wechat removed from the store.

Tencent, when you update the app every time in the future, keep in mind that there are users in US."
"Call functionality is decent but that’s not what I’m going to talk about. I forgot my password to my account. That account has a random unknown number linked to it. Which it could be my fault. it also has no emails linked to it. I could accept some accountability for that but what is upsetting is that there’s no way to contact support. The official website didn’t have a phone number listed nor had a chat function. The chat function part can be left out but any basic company would have a phone number to contact for any support. Let alone Tencent whose company worth is $134 billion. Basically if you’re in the US and you need some support, you’re screwed. This is completely unacceptable. If a small business can have a phone number, a multibillion dollar conglomerate should also have a number."
"I don’t understand why they decided to make it so that you can’t connect things like you email to your account from a device other than your phone, this has caused me several problems as I can’t log into my account from my phone as I got a new one recently and had my phone number changed and completely forgot my password this part was on me and I will admit I am partially at fault as I didn’t take the proper precautions before, but I thought it would be no big deal as I can just connect my email to the account from my ipad to login as I was still signed into the account on there, now I’m just left disappointed and annoyed as I can’t reset the password to my account or connect my email. I honestly think this should be changed as it makes no sense for me not to be able to connect my email from my ipad or other devices other than my phone."
"I made a WeChat account yesterday. I set a profile picture, downloaded some of the cute stickers, and that’s it. I didn’t do anything else in the app. This morning when I try to log in, it says my account is blocked due to suspicious activity. I’m like “ok...I guess I can request for it to be unblocked.” So I go through this lengthy process to unblock my account which, mind you, should never have been blocked in the first place. Then I get to the step where the only way to unblock it is through a friend on WeChat who has made an account over 6 months ago. Well guess what? I DON’T HAVE ONE. I made an account about a year earlier and the same thing happened then. My account was blocked when I hadn’t even used it. I wasted my time trying to unblock the account. I ended up deleting the app then, and I’ll be deleting it again right now."
"I wanted to try WeChat to see what it was all about. I try to sign up and it won’t let me past the verification part unless I have someone who uses WeChat help verify. To me this absolutely stupid if I never heard of this app before. I’m not going to go around on social media or any other means trying to find someone who uses the app just to help me verify. In a way I’m disappointed cause I enjoy trying new apps that allow you to communicate with new people, until I find out the app has nothing but bots and scammers. I unfortunately will never know if this app is actually real or not cause of the stupid verification process that I am unable to do. So with that being said I give this app a 1 star. If something can change with the verification process where I’m able to move forward and explore the app more then I can write a new review with a possible better rating."
"Wechat has became the most successful app for business and other uses , so i lately found that if you add a quote function  in the moment page and directed  to the person who posted an article or a picture without  saving a picture and making our Phone’s gallery full of pictures . 
It is like a quick reply to ask for how admiration you like the photo or asking for the price 
Because WeChat is mostly for commercial business most  i think , so this function  is for whom to quick reply without being noticed as he comments down the post 

Best wishes"
"I downloaded this app in order to communicate with a group for college. I downloaded the app, created an account. Everything worked fine. The second time I opened the app THAT VERY SAME DAY it had logged me out, and when I tried to sign in, a message popped up saying my account had been deactivated due to suspicious registration. Of course, the only way to recover your account is to have another WeChat who has had an account for at least a month verify your identity, but I didn’t know anyone else at the time who had used the app long enough to verify me. THERE NO EMAIL RECOVERY OPTION. And, since you have to enter your phone number, not your email, to create an account, it is impossible to create another account if you get locked out of your old one (you can create a new email address, but you only have one phone number). Customer service WILL MOT ANSWER. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. TERRIBLE APP."
"The app locked me out for suspicious activity, I wasn't in the app, I didn't have the app open, how is that suspicious? Is it because I'm not using their app 24/7, perhaps it's because I'm not from it's country of origin? Nah, it comes down to just good old fashion poor coding, something universal.
In what little time I was on the app I found it to be clean and some interesting features. I just didn't have time to make friends on it, so I'm locked out with zero way back in. How about the developer try that in reverse? Make it so you have to have friends to register, that way I don't waste my time on such a poorly designed poorly coded back end system, which I could just be using the book of faces for that.

There are other apps out there that don't have the problem, I'm sure there are apps that are worse than this. Save your time, find some other way to message each other."
"I understand the security aspects of Wechat and really appreciate that, but for someone who is using Wechat for fun this has become useless. Anyone who is using Wechat have an option to secure their own account, the platform should only provide controls but it should be left to the individual to secure their own account. There is no point for the platform to deny someone access and lock them out of their account because they send too many friends requests or someone marks the account as spam. The platform can rate limit the requests. Also, it will be great to provide an option to set location and search for friends elsewhere. That will be great."
"This review is strictly on wechat for iPad. 

I love wechat on phones. However, since I use it both on phone and iPad, I found the iPad chat functionality extremely unpredictable. Only fewer than 1/3 of the chats show up on iPad. If I don’t look at my phone, I won’t even know how many messages are missing. If I’m on the iPad when a chat message comes in, iPad will show the notification at the top. If I click on the notification, it doesn’t take me to the chat and that message will not show up in the chat.   I can’t figure out a pattern of when a chat message will show on the iPad. The only consistent time is probably when I’m actively chatting with someone, then I get all messages in this particular chat on iPad. But not for other chats. Please fix this!"
"Created a new account last night.
Added family members as friends.
Noticed it got blocked this morning.
Followed the steps to unblock it, requested help from family and friends.
Nothing worked.

I sent requests to 3 of my family members, which 2 of them for sure didn’t work due to phone numbers being in a different country. What disappointed me the most, was my mother’s, my MOTHER’S phone number. It’s the exact same region as mine! But what did your team say to my mom? “You have already reached the limit of times of helping friends unblock their accounts.” And then second time, “You do not meet the requirements to unblock this account.” 
After those three accounts, I tried to request it one more time, but it kept on stalling to load the option, it didn’t want to load again.
I also like to ask, What in the world type of suspicious activity did my account end up doing? All the agreements were secure, and the app itself doesn’t agree with it?

This is a complete disappointment!

I’m not the only one experiencing this. Look at the older reviews written this year. Many new users out there are complaining about the same situation. You’re going further away from 5 stars. Please fix this issue before more negative ratings come."
"Created an account and tried to log in and it immediately locked my new account, calling it “suspicious”! So I used my daughter as a contact to help unlock it, which it did until I tried to log in again. Then it locked me out again. 
I searched to see if possibly they were having server issues, and it turns out the app is owned or controlled (or both) by the Chinese government and people suspect the government of monitoring dissidents through their use of the app. I’m only guessing here, but if this is true then my using other peoples phone numbers to try to get my phone unlocked it would seem to be nothing but a phishing attempt by the Chinese government to find more people who are using the app. You would think that they would know the answer to that already I don’t know, maybe they got hacked and lost the info. Who knows. I deleted the app it’s useless."
"WeChat is a fundamental part of life in China, as are WeChat groups. There’s a group for everything!! That being said your chats seem to be polluted by a constant inflow of group messages, even if you’ve silenced the group chat it automatically goes to the top of the chat list when there are new messages and other conversations get pushed down causing you to miss messages. I really do wish that there was tabs for chats and groups and both tabs had the sticky on top function so that even on the group tab you could have your work group on top. This would make WeChat so much more functional as a work and social tool."
"Blocked my account after one day of use, even though I had a valid phone number and only added one friend starting out. From what I’ve read online and talking to others, this is a common occurrence. It’s a shame because I liked this app. I tried contacting support but had no response in a week. All there support forms are broken on there website, so you can’t even fill anything out to try unblocking your account yourself. People who do have accounts are never “verified” by there terms, so they can’t verify your account as another way to unblock. It seems they only have an interest in up-keeping this app for China use, where they are based, so I don’t understand why they are trying to distribute it anywhere else when no one can get accounts nor any help! Never have I seen an app be this disastrous just for a chat app. It’s frustrating and ridiculous."
"Wechat is a good product. It’s very easy to use. Some of my relatives in their 80s are using Wechat on daily basis. One feature I have been wishing for is to allow a user to blacklist certain people in same Wechat group. One trouble I am experiencing is that there are members in a group keep posting disturbing info. I do not want to quit the group (could be a family group or a high school classmate group) just because one or couple of person. I don’t want to argue with them either. I wish there is a feature allowing me to make posts from these folks invisible to me, unless they directly address me."
"WeChat is very good and easy to use, however, when I type a message to my friend, I want to change change a line to make it clearer for my friend to see. But everytime, there's no change line button, at that place, there said send instead of enter (change line). Then, some time later, I figure out that you need to press space until it's end of the line then type. It's very tiring for me and sometimes, one message contains 113 spaces just for changing my line, I was so tired at that time so please replace the send button to a enter button instead. And the send button can be beside the ··· button. Thanks! I hope this change in the future!"
"I really like this app and I’ve been using it for 6 or 7 years now. It’s really easy to use and it has a lot useful features. However, I really would like a dark mode theme so that when I use the app at night , it wouldn’t be that bright. Also, I am wondering if we can customize the chat bubble color, I mean the green is fine and it is the iconic color of wechat, but if we can have the option to customize it, that will be great. It doesn’t have to be really fancy, just some simple basic colors that will be fine. And thank you for making this app great!"
"I love this app very much, but one thing needs to change from the beginning. The thing is when we posted the pictures on moments or discover but forgot to add some pictures, want to replace the picture that is already posted, etc.... is should have “Edit” with “Like, Comment” next to it. So that I don’t have to delete the whole thing to repost it. What happen if my friends liked my post already when I noticed that I forgot to post or add some pictures in discover and just hit delete just to repost it. Is no use! So please add “Edit” when post is already post with “Like and Comment”! Thanks!!"
"Just like a previous comment, my account was mysteriously blocked for no apparent reason for 7 months after years of using the account. Despite having contacts in China verify my account, the recovery process was circular and useless; whatever prompt they gave me to follow always brought me back to another prompt and another prompt and then rejection.

Was never given any explanation as to why this happened. If it was a bug, I hope developers are more sensitive to fixing them promptly and creating a way for users to reach out to an IT representative who can help them instead of a robot . Very frustrating. I really missed communicating with a dear friend in China while I couldn’t sign in"
"It is a shame that Trump Administration decided to kill this app. It only demonstrates how convenient and powerful it truly is. I wish the order could be reversed, because building another wall on Internet is a Shame in US history. I just cannot believe I am seeing this in 2020. This is like seeing Trump’s coronation in US.  The app collects information just like all other apps we are using daily, goolge, Facebook, snapchat, and the only thing that made it getting banned is Greedy from a President who wants to get voted by promoting hatred against Chinese."
"I am a American guy who travels a lot throughout Asia and this is mostly used by the Asian community so it makes it very easy to connect with new friends! It’s super easy to use and it never has any issues in the 10 years that I’ve been using it. 
TO THE DEVELOPERS!! 
I do have a suggestion for you! How about some page themes so people can change the color and customize the look of their WeChat? Of course you charge money for this but I think it will increase overall revenue and give people a more personalized feel for the app which, will in turn, boost the app usage! 
Just a thought :)"
"Wechat has been nice and easy to use for the past few years. I just wish there could be some parity functionality as slack to pin some content in one channel/group instead of saving them all in one favorite place and soon be buried by the next content. 
Also as there r more and more groups available, they always pop up to the top. If we can fold them into one bigger group like nested group function, it would help a lot for the user’s day to day experience. 
Hope some product manager from wechat could consider this."
"Does what is claims to do, but quality is poor.  If you send a photo, by default it is low quality.  Selfie camera is broken—it sends mirror images.  File transfer is poor.  Very conservative limit on file size, and it often is not downloadable if the receiver doesn’t download it quickly.  Translation is extremely poor—it gives insight to how uneducated Chinese people are when it comes to English.  Recently the app asks me to verify my identity even though my passport is already registered to my account.  Since the payment function depends on ID verification and the ID verification is broken, now I cannot use WeChat to pay for things.  A typical all around low-quality Chinese app with lots of oversights.  Please fix."
So glad to have tried this. Now it’s my only social networking app. It has great privacy features and actually does NOT spy on your like Fartbook or others. Love the recall function whereby you can recant in private or group chat within 2 minutes of posting. Also love the privacy-respecting Moments feature where your posts are only visible to your friends by default. Simply the best messaging and social networking app by far! Just wish we could use the Pay feature here in the States.
"If you have the app installed, you can literally do anything in one app. Genius design. Not mention free message, video chat, voice message, location pin, scan and pay,find friends near by, make donation to charity, selling or buying goods etc and more, I saw ppl running millions dollars business in this app. Jaw dropping..I wish we have a similar app in US, so we don’t have to download 10+apps to get our jobs done. We used to judge ppl too much ,didn’t realize that we should learn from them on some point. IMHO"
I have had to unlock my account several times because of the new security changes. I use this app for work with clients over seas and it’s starting to make me loose business. I can’t access anything once I get locked out. If I try to log into my laptop it says there is suspicious activity. It locks me out all the time and now I have reached my Max account verification. I tried to get people to unlock it with the help a friend unlock the account and they all can’t do it because they get an alert that says they reached the max to help a friend. Then they get locked out because of suspicious activities. This is a horrible security development and should be changed ASAP because they will start to loose business. I wish I Can add pics to show proof of what I have to deal with.
"So yesterday I made an account on WeChat and all I did was use one of their mini programs (the one that enhances quality, idk what it’s called) and that’s it! Then today I go to open up the app and it tells me my account is blocked due to “suspicious activity” I’m like ok?? so it tells me I can unblock it so I go through this lengthy process to unblock it and after all that it tells me I have to have a friend who’s been on WeChat for 6 months unblock my account, guess what? I DONT HAVE ONE. This is absolutely ridiculous, I haven’t done anything suspicious on the account and I’ll be deleting the app now. Maybe in the future I’ll try again if you guys ever fix the issues clearly running through this app."
"Terrible app. Tried to log in because I remember making an account a while back. After multiple security login pages and confusing terms and conditions and agreements that WEREN'T EVEN WRITTEN IN ENGLISH !!! I finally got through for it to give me an ERROR WRITTEN IN CHINESE that said that the app is not up to date! WHICH IT WAS! Tried the sign up screen and it required a ""friend"" to authenticate??? But I already used a ""friend"" aka my 60 year old mother !!! in one of the log in security pages and because of that it wouldn't allow me to do anything! Absolutely terrible user interface. Confusing and convoluted for no reason at all! It shouldn't be this hard for an old user to log inm If I couldn't give this app zero stars I would!"
"like what? one of the best apps i have EVER used, literally incredible. it’s so easy to block people, send voice messages, transfer money and even pay using just one app. you can also post stuff and watch channels (basically tiktok, you can follow creators and create ur own account as well as being able to see what’s trending and what your friends have liked) i never knew there could be so many functions within one app. It’s all around the best app and definitely my most used one. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
"I am a second generation Chinese American. During the Coronavirus pandemic and the recent looting, Wechat served as a platform of giving away misleading news to the Chinese community. The information presented on Wechat news are exaggerated with the purpose of gaining views from its readers. With the inaccurate information, the Asian (specifically Chinese) who use Wechat as their main information provider are put in the state of anxiety and terror. My mother also fell victim to Wechat’s news. Other second generation Chinese Americans can probably relate to me. Due to the misleading information on the app, many of our parents were convinced to buy guns. There should be an authority figure to monitor the news that app users post to guarantee the authenticity of the information."
"(Now that I’ve written the review, I tried again and strange enough it works... still no explanation as to why this happened to me in the first place)This app checked all the boxes and all my friends use it but everything went downhill when I changed phones. I couldn’t recover my old account and WeChat prevents me from making a new one. I just get some cryptic message about “suspicious registration” and I can’t reach out to WeChat, there’s no information about my issue anywhere.. it is ridiculous. I’m at a point now where I can only talk to those with iPhones since it’ll cost way too much to text those without"
"Love the App, I’ve been using this app for a few years now. It has some great features for chatting, speaking, and video. Also love that you can make new friends through other features like People Near You, Shake, and Message In a Bottle. 
I’m not impressed with the Tech Support. About a month ago when using the shake feature I got a “To Many Attempts, Try Again Later” error. I’ve submitted a couple of requests for help including a screen shot and still no help. 
Overall, I recommend the App and think you will be happy with it."
"I was going to use the app to do multiple video chat calls but with the new update on my phone I can already do that so I have no need for the app. Hence, why I want to cancel it.  However the app won’t allow me to cancel my account because it keeps claiming I’ve made changes to the account or there’s “strange activities”.   I have not made any changes. I tried deleting it two week ago—on the same day I downloaded the app.  Now two weeks have passed and today I was trying to delete the app and again it won’t allow me to delete it. I’ve tried contacting their customer support and it directed me to Golden frog and Golden frog says they have nothing to do with the Wechat app.  If I can get someone to please help me with this, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you!"
"WeChat is wonderful application, I am using it since 2015, I was using it before to contact my friends in China, but after moving to China, I am a regular user now because life in China is without WeChat is impossible. WeChat mainly focus on users privacy and due to that reason it my favorite application. But I feel one thing that is not added yet and that is built it lock. Just like WhatsApp and QQ International Messenger. I am giving 5 Starts as a satisfied used and hoping to consider my review."
"Overall happy with wechat and how fast it deploys and shares images, media etc. however one crucial deficiency in my (and likely many others’) opinion is the lack of the REPLY button. It’s impossible to hold any sort of long conversation that spreads over multiple topics without struggling over the reply button!  
Every chatting app nowadays has a reply button for a selected highlighted message so i do not need to copy/paste manually anytime i need to address a part of the dialogue. Currently for every eversoslightly complicated conversation i have to go over to QQ because at least they have Reply button. This is a huge inconvenience."
"I wish I could leave a good review of WeChat, (or any review of WeChat for that matter) but unfortunately since I’ll never be able to use the app I can’t review it.

Why can’t I use the app?
Because the app requires me (a new user who has never tried this app before) to already know other users in order to sign up and make a login. How can I be expected to know other users when I can’t make an account and get on WeChat to meet other users? What am I supposed to be psychic?? What if none of my rl friends or acquaintances already use it?

But the sign up requirement doesn’t stop at just simply knowing another person who already uses the app! This person has to also have used WeChat for over a month, hasn’t completed “Help Friend Register” for other users in the past month, AND hasn’t been blocked in the past month. How am I possibly expected to know someone who meets those requirements when I’ve never used the app??

Most ludicrous sign up requirement I’ve ever heard of, makes it just about impossible for new users to make an account."
"This is a great app, but when it updated and had gotten dark mode, everything was ruined. I like keeping dark mode on my phone, but I don't like the dark mode on WeChat. WeChat dims my custom background and it isn’t what I want. I suggest to either keep the background the way it is, or to make a dark mode setting so it will be manual. If people like dark mode like this, please make dark mode a setting that you can manually turn on and off. If you are a WeChat user, and you like bright backgrounds, I highly suggest you not to update WeChat. PLEASE. CHANGE IT BACK TO NORMAL OR MAKE IT MANUAL. Thank you for reading this."
"Everything is pretty much amazing, really nothing to complain about. I got this app around 2 years ago and use it since most of my family use this app. I think they should make it so we’re allowed to change or ringtone or text tone. It gets pretty boring after 2 years and having the ability to change it could really help. Other than that, it’s all good!"
"So, here’s the story,
I’m going to China in a few days and decide to make a wechat account. I use my iPhone to make an account so I can log into it on my iPad, I have a bad iPhone and decide to not bring it whatsoever. I go to china, and I think it’s fine. I want to order something for my friends and when I open my wechat account, it was blocked. It showed that it would send an sms to my phone to request an unblock, which was in my house, nowhere near china. I try to see if it could send an sms to my friend’s phone, but yet again, it said that it would only send one to my old phone. Now, I have to wait a whole month, just to get my account, having to always ask for someone to pay for my meal

Great System, 
WeChat"
"So I basically have 2 problems:
1. My iwatch series 3 works fine with my previous iPhone 6s. When in switch to iPhone X, I cannot view any WeChat message from watch. I get notifications but cannot open it. It prompted me to restart phone and turn off wechat on watch to reset, but still does not work after multiple times. Very inconvenient and I don’t know if it’s a watch problem or a phone issue.

2. The help and feedback section on phone version wechat is not completely visible. The bottom section that allows people to input feedback is completely blocked by the bottom swipe control of the iPhone X, and there is no way to access the bottom buttons of the wechat help page."
"Try to setup an account for personal use only. I am very careful not to let it go through my address book. so I deny to let the app have access to my contact. I don’t let you have all my contact because I won’t sell my contact out to you!! ridiculously you blocked my phone saying that my account is compromised, make me go through security check need other wechat member to unblock it. Forget about it. Too stupid to go through this. You are the one I don’t trust. Couple years ago, i let you have access to my old phone, you add everyone (included friends and clients) on my phone book to wechat. Have you consider my privacy? I don’t want everyone in my contact links on any social media !!!!!"
This is the worst app I have ever seen in my life. There is absolutely nobody in any locations I want and when you try to delete the app or delete your account and cancel it they won’t let you for a two week period. I have gone over the two week period and it says I keep changing stuff and will not delete the app still. Worst app ever. Still trying to get rid of it. You put in your information and now it has your phone number and type of phone in it. You can’t change it or delete it because it says if you have a change you can’t cancel your account and you can’t leave things blank. All I want to do is cancel my account and get rid of this so none of my information is on here.
I have been using wechat for a pretty long time and I use a iPad mini 3. I check my wechat settings and it says 7. 0. 20 which is the most current and latest version. I can’t find dark mode 😂 I really can’t. I went to “me” -> “settings” -> “help&feedback” and clicked “how do I set dark mode?”. It says to go to Me > settings > general > dark mode > enable automatic. But I cant find the dark mode option in my general settings on wechat. Someone please helppp!!!
"I'm in the US and was very excited to learn about WeChat, as it provided me a way to communicate with new friends in China. I set up the account, found my 2 friends, and was loving it...for about three days. Then, I got logged out and was unable to log back in. My account was then blocked and, like others have said, it's nearly impossible to get it unblocked. You have to provide information from other WeChat users. I only knew two people on WeChat and I could not access their information since I was blocked from my account. I finally found two people in the US and sent in their Information so they could verify me. Nothing. I've sent multiple emails to WeChat with no luck. So frustrating. Zero stars"
"The app is good for communication and interactions with people mainly in China, it allow us to connect with them since there’s not a lot of apps to use to talk with them. I saw that many of the one star reviews are about accidentally nudging the other user in certain cases. But I think that’s just a small problem. The nudging happens when you double click the users profile. Overall there’s not a lot of distractions. Just be careful."
"I just signed in and in a couple of days and I got blocked. I used actually my Facebook account AND my number. I was pretty excited because this app has soo many amazing reviews. I did nothing. I just signed in, change my photo and finish. I had my account activated maybe for 3 days? 4? But then, when I tried to check my account again it said that I got blocked and I needed someone help. I have no friends with wechat that fit with the criteria needed to help me. I just can’t change my number and I don’t know what to do:( I really want to use my account, please help me"
"WeChat has been my number one app of all time. I have met wonderful people from all over the world all for free. I never had a complaint until now. One day I open the WeChat and I use the shake function. All I get are Chinese and the profiles seem fake. I have messaged over 300 Chinese women with no replies. I do not think the profiles are real. None of the profiles have moments and all the photos are fuzzy. I want my old WeChat shake back or I can chat with women from the Philippines, Malaysia the US and Europe. Am I being punished or what? My people nearby works great it’s just the shake only goes to China with no results."
"About several months ago, the pics and videos from moments started to load so slow. There’s a five second waiting period each time I open up someone’s pic in moments. I’m just staring at the loading icon during this time for the pic to download. I have used the app for years and it’s always been great. This new phenomenon is really annoying and makes me not want to look at anyone’s moments, and this is why I’m giving this a two star.  This is the first review I have written in the App Store so you can see this is a huge  issue for me!! Please fix it!!!!  (I tried clearing cache, updating to latest version, etc but no difference)."
"I first downloaded this app when I was in the US. I assumed it was just a normal chat app because it didn’t have many features when I downloaded it. After going to China and connecting my Chinese bank card with the app, it unlocked so many features. You can literally do everything with this app. Pay your  bills, buy train/plane tickets, transfer money, buy movie tickets, get a taxi, order food, find a cleaner... This is definitely the most underrated app in the App Store."
"I just want to know the thought process (if there was any thought behind it ) of the people who decided to enforce verification by another person for creating an account? 
How about to take bonds and put someone from family as a hostage while using the app to make sure it's not against the Chinese Communist rules and regulations?
What if I am living in rural area and there is no other Wechat user who didn’t help someone else to get security verification?
Isn’t it better to limit this app to Communist countries only so you can enforce the communist party’s policies?
I am wondering how Apple allowed such a horrible requirement exist under their nose."
"I have used WeChat for many years and I usually liked the new functions it developed. However, I do not like the new tickle function. I have accidentally tickled someone in a group chat or someone I’m not familiar with several times. I think it’s really awkward. I have several work-related group chats and I’m always nervous about tickling anyone by accident. Please let users choose to disable this function in the future. Thanks."
"This is the absolute best chatting app ever created. It is very easy to use to chat individual person or a group. The moment feature is also very useful, especially that you can block certain people from seeing certain moments 😉 I love the emojis in WeChat, there’s multiple very useful sets of emojis and you can always add any emojis of you choice. The money transfer feature is also very useful, and is not present in any other chatting apps. This is the best chat app ever."
"WeChat is the most convenient and widely used communication app in China and among Chinese who are in abroad. It doesn’t show others whether you read the message or not. Therefore it protect our privacy better than WhatsApp. Also it is multifunctional, combining Facebook, instagram, WhatsApp all together. It deserves its popularity and wide usage. If Trump ban TikTok or WeChat, then he is a most notorious dictator in history."
"The app was fine until last update. Now it forces WeChat into dark mode because my iPhone system is in dark mode too. There is no way to change it unless you change the system-wide setting.

Every app out there let’s you override the dark/light setting of your phone. Please let us use whatever mode we want regardless of the OS setting.

That said, the dark mode itself is bad. All my stickers are messed up because of the dark background. Doesn’t seem like the update was thought through."
"WeChat blocked my account while I was traveling in Asia. I couldn’t perform any of the verifications to correct the account since I didn’t have access to my USA phone number while abroad. The conference organizers and attendees were using WeChat as the exclusive method of communication, so I was completely cut off. I lost access to my collection of contacts. WeChat said that my account had suspicious activity, but I have no idea what that was, or how to correct it. Now that I’m back in the States, WeChat still will not unblock my account. It’s unacceptable for a platform of this scope, which so many people depend upon, to be cut someone off without warning or recourse. Relying on WeChat while in China was a disaster."
"I see comments there are some people in the United States said that the software is not good, some problems cause you use effect is not good, but I ask you to know that this software is a lot of people in the use of software in China, his influence is very strong, now he is found in North America the app, does not mean it is for you to use, and most of it is for our Chinese students, you don't like to give up. There's no need to say where it's dead, of course I'm not racist about anything."
"I am an American user and I can sign in no problem. It’s not that wechat didn’t want American users, but Trump banned it in US. Usually they ban you not because of no reason but because someone reported you. Of course the need to find evidence first. Wechat is a great app, it has high quality calls, millions of sticker packs, group call (WITH VIDEO if you want), moments (so you can catch up with your friends."
"Hello dear developers
I made a WeChat account recently, about two weeks ago, and I didn’t need to use it until today. Surprisingly my account was restricted because of suspicious and unusual activity 😑😑
Well I’ve been trying to log into my account for five hours and I’ve gone through all the steps but it still doesn’t work!! Two friends tried helping me but it still doesn’t work! Excuse me? I shouldn’t have been blocked in the first place and now I’m really annoyed because I’ve done everything the app requested me to do to get my account back and it doesn’t work 😑 please do something I need my account to communicate with some new Chinese coworkers and I’m helpless right now."
Everything about this app is terrible. From the moment I opened the app I was greeted with a typical sign in or sign up screen ok normal. So I click sign up then put in my info. Then I had to security check this is where the stupidity was created. Instead of using an sms or email verification you need to have a friend verify you. This friend could not have verified anyone for at least a month  previous. There customer service is bad overall starting with the website and the unresponsive email and text. In my opinion if you want a free app that does the same thing go use WhatsApp or telegram both great apps with good customer service and easy straightforward sign up services.
"The system allows you to convert into a handful of languages other than Chinese; however, the file transfer is often named by some Chinese characters when your trying to upload some documents, which is quite confusing since the system ought to be operating under a full English version after the switch. Other similar cases appear once in awhile when your browsing through the app. When problems resembling to those I’ve faced in terms of their recklessness, it makes you wonder the effort put into the design and testing of the app... Anyway, WeChat really need to refine their language settings."
"Incredibly annoying issue where voice messages keep cutting me off before I finish and send them.  This is ridiculous.  Allow a feature to let me stop recording or at least don’t stop when I have the button clearly pressed and hold.  Also another insanely annoying feature is the inability to use Return to go to the next line.  This is problematic as I cannot type addresses with line breaks.  It will send each line as a separate message.  Also the inability to backup entire chat history with pictures and videos like iMessage, is absolutely unacceptable.  Fix these 3 issues, and this trash app will become one of the best."
"I opened my account and began using this app to communicate with my business partners but then somehow got blocked. We double-checked - Everyone in our groups said they didn't block my account.

Despite my and my associate's attempts to contact this business for help, NO ONE at WeChat CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THERE TO HELP! :( 

So anyway long story short, we stopped using WeChat and are now happy GroupMe (by Skype) users! GroupMe offers so much more than this app: create RSVP calendar events, send photos, invite ppl to groups, add/delete ppl to groups, ppl can delete themselves from groups but easily join (with invite from current group member), can receive SMS rather than thru this app (doesn't send emoticons)."
"I recently bought new iPhone12Pro and download my wechat. However!!!!  I found out there is so hard to longer press the voice button to talk since IPhone12Pro is no home button with just a plane of screen.. Every time when I want to press the voice button to send the voice messages and it will just direct me to the app switcher since the holding button is too close to the bottom control home key. 
关于微信语音功能键与苹果12Pro无法很好适配的情况我需要详细说明一下，自从换了iPhone12Pro我发现微信的语音聊天功能无法精准的按下，因为距离屏幕底线太近，每次按住都会出现语音无法正常流利地发送..时常会滑走到别的应用端口因为距离屏幕底端的主菜单键实在太近.."
I use the app and anyone can report you just because they want to be a jerk and instead of looking at the history or anything we chat will block you and suspend you I think the app needs to allow someone to decent there self... if they allow you to use shake feature how can they suspend you because you sent a unwanted message to someone else that uses shake? Why not delete that function if you don’t want someone to send a message it’s a crappy tech support you can’t email them or report issues... they give you a small amount of letters to use for feedback or support help .... it’s a app that can be good it’s a shame they only listen to one side of a story
"I didn’t rate the app cuz I really haven’t used it yet, but right off the bat, I need to say something. So, I went to “mobile friends” to see if anyone in my contacts were on WeChat. I was surprised to find that it had one of my friends listed. The profile pic looked nothing like them, but I figured it was just an online pic that she found and liked, so she used it. However, when I texted her to make sure it was the right person, she said she was NOT on the app, and hadn’t even heard about it. So,  I don’t how that happened, and I am wondering if I can even trust this app..."
"App is OK just the same old typical WeChat but I’m not a fan of the newly “White” Theme design. Come on, 2019 is coming in hours and you introduced us a White Theme where almost every other apps are doing Dark Theme!!! Are you kidding me? My eyes are getting tired because of your stupid new theme color you so-called “intuitive design.” I seriously doubt about your design R&D department because they simply don’t do any research. Please improve it or rather give us the freedom of theme choices. Sorry, again I have to take 3 stars off because of this terrible theme color."
Whatever is going on with these inventors I had a WeChat account or year ago when my daughter went to China. I had one for two days when my wife’s been in Cancun this morning I wake up and it tells me it cannot connect me because of what I have no idea of. I’ve tried a couple passwords that I knew no go. Tried to reboot it won’t let me do anything just put in my phone number that’s wrong put in her phone number that’s wrong put in this phone number that’s wrong put it in any password that’s wrong this WeChat is for the birds find another way to communicate other than WeChat now I can’t talk to my wife them at all I’ll have to use my phone see what happens
"It’s great if it works, but i recently changed my phone number and had the hardest time linking my new phone to my old one. The purpose of this app is to stay connected with people.... i only use it to chat with my parents. It’s asking me to have “friends” verify my account. My parents are not very tech savvy, so getting them to verify is not something i can do until i visit them in person. I tried to sign up for a new account and it didn't work. I tried to change my number... and it says account compromised. (Probably because I tried so many times...) I wish the app was more user friendly."
"Please help address an important privacy setting prob: when one chooses to only open his most recent three days’ posts, this setting applies to EVERYONE. But realistically, he might want a few exceptions where several best friends or families could see ALL of part of his posts, whereas the rest of his friends are subject to the three-day limit. I highly advocate for an upgraded version considering this problem—it would be great if we can use this function!!"
"As an instant chatting app, this app does not notify me when my girlfriend sends messages to me. This is extremely annoying. My girlfriend is very upset with me because of this. The message playback have been a major feature for a long time, but this app constantly fails at this job. When I click play, and put my phone close to my ear in my office, you know what? While the voice memo is being played in the upper speaker for my ear, it will suddenly stop, black out, then switch to the louder speaker, letting all my colleague in the office hear it. It happened hundreds of times by now."
"The WeChat is probably the largest and busiest social network platform in the world so you may wonder why there are so little reviews, even the negative one.  This is because everyone is busy using the app itself instead of writing reviews.  If you haven’t use it before, try it. If you are going to China, definitely download one and start to use it.  The Chinese life style is going to spread to the entire world soon."
"I didn’t know about this app until I traveled to China in June/July of 2017. I met a number of people there while I was working. Facebook and other apps were blocked while I was there. 

I was able to use WeChat to keep in contact with my family in the United States. Now that I’m back home, I’m able to keep in touch with some of the people I met in China. I even had someone call me from China for free using WeChat. The call was crystal clear."
I used WeChat for more then 4 years. And I had been blocked or can’t get in to my account. I don’t know why it’s did that. And it happens a lot. Even my friends and my family got blocked too. This app really gets my Nerves!! I hate this app so much! Every thing is gone even my family and friends is gone as well so I have to restart it over again!!!!! Hope they change this cause so far this is the most unwillingly app. Makes you angry when it happens. Hope this help you! And read this before you had Download the app. Everything else is fine.
"I love love this app it is the best but here is some recommendations. 1. If someone is texting pls fix it so we know they are going to say something. 2. This is last one is very important because if you send something to someone else i want to know when they read my message. 

So hopefully you can change the things i asked for but you don’t have to!♡"
"No matter if you login using Facebook or apple, you need to provide your phone number and have someone verify you. Otherwise signup cannot be completed.
This is very sketchy as to why they even have OpenID to authenticate with other providers if it’s the same as mobile signup regardless. 

Only reasonable answer for this behavior is to get her customer data and still require the same signup flow. That way they can store your Facebook login information, Apple ID and your phone number. 

No matter what you need to go through mobile signup which requires you to have someone who already has a WeChat account to verify you within minutes. Do not bother with other signup options as they aren’t necessarily options but just ways to get extra data. They only allow deletion depending on local laws, not by their own policy so make sure to look up your local/country laws on data and privacy."
"WeChat has been censoring messages and blocking people’s accounts for privately talking to their friends about democracy in Hong Kong. If you have friends and family in China, this is scary. Even those of us not in China are monitored, censored, spied on, and controlled.

China’s diabolical control over their own citizens is horrible enough but preventing non-Chinese users from communicating with each other in America isn’t something Apple or anyone should stand for.

Why is it okay for a company to cut off communication from our friends and family for saying anything that isn’t 100% positive about china’s government? We live in America! We are American!"
Once you are blocked in this app it is impossible to unblock.    I have have been blocked for close to a month now.   I have tried to contact the app support several times and have had no contact back.   I have uninstalled and installed the app several times with no luck.   It says I have a self service unblock capable.  But when when ever I get to the last steps it says wrong password or the sms was not received.   I can’t ask anyone for help because most people I know who use wechat are on the mainland of China and I only had their info on WeChat.   Really if you can’t respond and help the users in the U.S. then you shouldn’t offer it to us.
"WeChat is a great app and all, the payment system, the convenience, the quality of the voice calls, everything. I really enjoy using this app on a daily basis in China, keep it up Tencent. One thing I hope Tencent adds to WeChat is the ‘read’ feature, it is when if the person has looked over your message/item it alerts or somehow tells you that he/she has read it. Refer to the already existing read feature on Messages on iOS"
"I wish Wechat does not remove or discontinue stickers! I absolutely loved my Disney (Mickey and Princesses) stickers but I changed phones, and decided to change my account (since I cannot change my user id anymore). Lo and behold, my favorite stickers were gone and I cannot get them back! They are not available in the app anymore :( Main reason why I like using Wechat is because of those stickers. Now they’re gone. Devastating! I hope you bring those stickers back! Please.."
"The bad thing=It a pretty good app but the problem is that some time it just logged me out and it is very annoying and also the Log in it so complex and it insanely annoying and same as my friend he just log out for no reason I was able to help him it still annoying and you should fix it.

The good thing=it very fun chatting with my friend it also helped my school the video call and voice call is very use full and it just a overalls good app but plz fix the bugs."
"Why does this app need you to be older than 17? There is harmless things in it and you can choose your friends on it. If you choose the right friends then you won’t see harmful content. Also, all most people do is chat on this app. Some people might not have phones and have friends they want to stay in touch with on the weekend, but now, you took that away from them! Lastly, I think the old age limit of 13 is perfectly fine because apps like TikTok are way more mature, but still have an age limit of 13. Its not like I don’t like the app, it’s just the age limit."
"The app contains features that normally don’t belong in a social media app, like the mini programs and games and such. I personally don’t like it, but it’s not intrusive. I can understand why others would like it though. 

I like the addition of dark mode, but it doesn’t look that great. The colors look a little off... Not really sure why but I think it’s because the dark colors aren’t dark enough? Also for the green text messages? Maybe add a way so users can disable dark mode in the app?"
I love this app it is just that you need another person to help you sign in. Super difficult. I tried to help my friend to sign  in but we were face timing and I couldn’t. I really think WeChat should update this so you don’t have to need someone else to help you sign in. Thank goodness that my mom has WeChat to help have an account. But other than that I think this is a good app and really fun! (And a lot of verification things to)
"What were the developers thinking about, that caused such an idiotic registration??!!! It says my number is invalid (because it is from the new unlocked phone codes in my region ) the I tried registering with another number...every thing was going fine ,then it asks me one of my friends with at least 6 month presence in this ridiculous app should verify my account!
One question!! I am the first one between my friends who’s trying to use this useless app ,now how the hell should I verify??!!!! I wish I could give minus in rating instead of 1 star!
If you’re not from China, don’t waste your time for this idiotic, useless, ridiculous app"
"Who can tell me why my same account on my new phone suddenly requires mandatory input of all my full personal information including bank accounts before even able to use it? The page just pop up immediately after logging into the account, won’t even give a chance to see anything else, says either follow instructions by filling all your information or else export data and delete account, wow, after several years of using, this is their terms of service and privacy policy? Seriously?!"
"My wife and I use Wechat to stay in contact with friends and family in China and abroad. Losing access to Wechat could result in losing contact with people we care about. Having the US government ban or block a social media platform sure seems like a violation of our constitutional rights. As a loyal customer of Apple, I ask that Apple helps fight this new ban of Wechat in the United States."
"I use this to pay for things when I’m in china. They don’t accept American credit or debit cards though so I always have to give my Chinese friends cash and have them send me money to refill my wallet. I wish that wechat would take my money.

There are also a lot of pages that are all in chinese with no translation support. Like if you try to open utilities, bike sharing, or taxi ordering within the app it’s totally useless because it’s only in chinese.

The level of effort that’s put into foreign payment and language support is extremely low. It makes me sad."
"I really don’t like the notification sound from WeChat app, there is no way to change it or make it vibration. It very annoying play those tri-tone notification sound. Most time, I have to able notification, so I know who is texting me, but this default notification really annoying. Every time someone text to me other people can hear that in the public place. I hope there is vibration function or other function to change more soft notification sound."
"WeChat is cool overall. I like the emojis and the ability to change a chat background. WeRun is great as well.

I would like if I could respond to individual messages in a big group chat. It’s pretty inconvenient that I can’t do that now so I need to respond to everyone. I’d also like if I could react to (or at least like) a message, like I can in other messaging apps (like Discord and Facebook Messenger)."
"Honestly deserves 0 stars. Not sure what’s the issue. I have a friend who’s traveled to China and no other way to stay in contact with them. The app does not even let you create an account, deeming it completely useless. The security process requires you to have someone who already has account to verify your account for you. And yet how are you supposed to do this if you’re completely new and don’t have someone to verify your account FOR you? It’s ridiculous. If you can’t get on because you need someone else to verify your account, how are you even supposed to connect with people? Defeats the purpose"
"I understand why you guys don’t like Wechat but is more of a Chinese thing, not a lot of Americans uses it a lot, but in China almost everyone has it. It really easy for us to talk to each other that’s why we use it a lot and you could buy things like Apple Pay, now in China we don’t need our wallets or cash we just need our phones to pay stuff, it really easy for us to use."
"I love Wechat. It’ll always have a place in my heart because it helped me stay connected to my best friend on the opposite side of the planet. HOWEVER, in the last few/several months, it has sent very, very few of our messages. We’ve literally been trying to text each other simultaneously and both received NOTHING. Calls have been more of the same. On a different format, I’ll say “calling you now” and nothing happens on the other end.
Wechat appears to be dying and it’s incredibly frustrating."
"I’ve been using WeChat since 2012 and I’m not even that old myself, WeChat is probably the best app for me to stay connected with my families all over the world. I have family members spreed our in three different continents and it’s really hard to find another app that work so well for us. So yeah here I am with a 5 star review."
I just got a new iPhone and I can’t long on to my own wechat with the new number. So I created a new account. Right away there was someone else linked to my phone number. I made a new account and now I’m blocked. I try to unblock my number it said my number is abnormal to unblock it. I follow the steps and it said that the wechat account isn’t available. So I’m stuck with an account that is blocked and some person has linked my number to there wechat and got me stuck with a abnormal number and a block account. I don’t understand why I can’t log onto my old account with my new number nether. Glitch.
"When you sent a wrong file or messenger, they allow you to recall it. However, they also have a stupid design called delete. So, if you think delete means recall, just like me, the wrong file or messenger would be deleted in your account, but other people could still view it. And even if you found that you should select recall rather than delete, just like me, you cannot recall it any more because you just deleted it, especially they put delete option in front of recall option. Please, at lease put recall option first!!!!!!!"
I love this app I have 2 other communication apps but this one I use to talk with relatives.( I use the other ones to talk with friends) I love the translates option it’s wonderful. But I had another device that got kicked out and I couldn’t sign in so I had to create a new account other than that it's very nice.
"Ios 14 has this nice feature to allow Wechat only access selected photos. Every time I want to share via wechat a new photo, I simply check the new photo to be accessible for wechat. 

WeChat v7.0.17 only allows two options: either allow it to access all photos, or access those already selected. No more new photos can be added to the accessible list. 

This is wechat’s effort to force users either not sharing photos via wechat (which is not desirable) or share all photos. Hijacking! Completely violating Apple respect to privacy!"
"I recently deleted WeChat because it wasn’t letting me go on and I’ve tried to log in countless times, but it just kept logging me off. I thought by deleting the app and downloading it again would fix this issue and it did. However, afterwards I discovered that the new updated version of the app didn’t keep my previous conversations and photos with other people. Now, I’m really frustrated and upset and I really just want to get them back because I have some precious memories contained in them. SO PLEASE HELP ME !!!!!!!"
"This app wants to rule the world, but it still sticks you with Chinese characters in sub menus. This app/service just doesn’t work for a lot of things if you are not Chinese. Often notifications for messages do not come through. This app is a really bad battery hog...

I would have deleted this app years ago, but it is necessary when traveling in China due to its monopoly on the chat market in China. 

If China didn’t block Facebook so many years ago, this app would be irrelevant. Smart business move by China, but everybody is suffering as a result."
"The app is great for communicating with all my friends around the world but it’s a bit disappointing that in order to translate you have to scroll all the way to the end every time making it time consuming and inefficient. Translate should be one of the first tabs. Also, a dark mode theme would be great. This app is entirely to White and bright. 😳 I can’t use iOS smart invert because it distorts the pictures and background images in the app. Please fix so we can use this feature."
Super helpful platform for me to connect with all my friends and family in China or anyone who has any connection with China to get access to fun daily updates from friends. It’s a friendly app with almost everything you need to effectively communicate. Hopefully Trump won’t blindly block it for personal use whatsoever...🤞✌️🤟
"This is my first time to write a review, I really can’t stand the disgusting behavior of someone. This is indeed Chinese software, but will it affect your use? Why do you always stupidly think China is controlled by the Communist party without knowing it, even Tiktok is secretly collecting data from people all over the world? Is he so powerful, so formidable in your mind???"
"This app is brilliant! I love the wechat emojis and all of the features. The translation is a bit off; permanently delete has been translated to recall for some reason, which is a bit confusing at times. But still, great app! Very intuitive and easy to use, with a lot of features other apps don’t have! 

Definitely recommend : )"
"í αm chínєѕє αnd English and I can talk to my family my whole family whenever I  like it’s amazing I can’t believe it I can talk to my friends it’s nice my friends also have WeChat and my whole family does and my family to you can change your names or pictures whenever we likeMy favorite part of  wechat is that there are mini 
Games"
"This app is terrible. I’ve tried making an account multiple times but can never get past the security verification step. I’ve had 3 different people try to verify my account and none of them have gotten it to work! Every time someone tries to verify my account it tells them that they need to provide the last 4 digits of my ID number. What ID number? You can’t get an ID number until you make an account, yet you can’t make an account until someone verifies it for you. It’s ridiculous! This app is completely useless."
I started using wechat almost six years ago and lately i’ve been getting this shake problem that shows me only asian fellows for days nothing but asians and i can’t speak their language and it’s not happening to my friends only me and some people when i looked it up so what am i supposed to do plz answer me!...if anyone know’s the solution plz text me on facebook my name is Kevin maxwell the photo is me a guy kinda blond wearing a blue suit!
"One day after working fine for years on this same phone, it started saying there was no record of my account. Nothing about a block, it just no longer accepts my password or mobile # (US). Even though it SHOWS my mobile number and my avatar photo at the top of the screen! This is on iOS 12.

All account recovery options were rejected, including my QQ number. From there on the instructions were only in Chinese. Useless. Deleted the app.

Don’t waste your time. You’ll only lose your account and friend list in the end anyway."
"I tried using this app to connect with parents of students that I teach online. After creating my account, it was blocked for no reason. I have tried the steps for unlocking it with no success. Now it states that I need another WeChat user to verify me. I don’t know anyone with a WeChat. Why would my account even be blocked in the first place?? I’ve never tried to create an account before. Absolutely ridiculous. Completely useless help center. It won’t even let me delete my account because guess what, I would have to be able to log in to do that."
"The privacy on this app is much better than the likes of Facebook. A couple features that I believe would make this app into a 5 star experience would be to allow users to reply to individual messages like you can do on WhatsApp. Also consider offering a transliteration feature (mandarin to pinyin) for the Chinese learners amongst us. Other than these two suggestions, I have no complaints about wechat."
"This app is really good but I’m facing problem like my wechat is not connecting. I have fresh Internet connection even then unable to connect. I have restarted my cell phone 3 times but in vein regarding this app. All other apps are working properly. Now I’m reinstalling this app. Hope it works. 
Secondly bottle throw option is not working in my wechat app. I have American Apple ID. Help me out. Thanks wechat team."
"It’s basically impossible to sign up for if you don’t know Chinese people, which is just plain discriminatory. I only wanted to sign up so that I could give my online ESL students another option. So, of course, I don’t have a person who can verify my account. The entire idea of needing another person to verify “my” account is ludicrous to me. Why even bother allowing the app  in the U.S. if you don’t really want Americans using it and haven’t done any market research to appeal to our market. I like being connected to other countries am very disappointed."
"My work account got blocked. WeChat claims that I violated the rules and got reported without being specific. I contacted customer service to unblock my account and to find out what rules. I kept getting the same message with no REAl resolution to the problem. The account is blocked. I was sharing my experience with my friends and tons of them have experienced that. WeChat blocked their account without letting them know what went wrong. This is how they treat their customers! Be careful, users! Don’t save anything important in your account! You might lose everything overnight with NO reason!"
I love the app because I can use it to communicate with my friends in China and elsewhere but there are a few things that annoy me. I can use it on my laptop however I can’t see my friends timelines on my laptop. If I look through the timeline it takes forever to go through on the phone. If there was a way to use he calendar to see a specific date on my friends timeline it would be so much nicer. Make those changes and I would definitely give 5 stars
"I first wanted to say thank you to who ever developed this app is secure and so private no ones knows when you are online , you can’t transfer and receive payment instantaneous start a business from scratch I made millions of Rmb from this apps thank you Jack Ma you are a hero to me and changed my life .... WeChat just the best"
BEING DISABLED STUCK AT HOME MOST OF THE TIME. I ALSO SUFFER FROM POST TRAUMATIC STRESS SYNDROME. I’M NOT A OLDER LADY TO HAVE SO MANY HEALTH PROBLEMS. I ALSO HAVE CANCER I TOOK CHEMO TWO TIMES A DAY FOR THIRTY DAYS. THE CHEMO DIDN’T WORK. MY PTSD IS COMING FROM MY MOM PASSING AWAY AND TWENTY WEEKS LATER MY BROTHER WAS KILLED IN A CAR ACCIDENT. I WOKE UP ONE MORNING AND MY WHOLE FAMILY WAS DEAD. MY MUCH OLDER HUSBAND IS RETIRED AND WHEN THE GOVERNMENT SAID GO BACK TO WORK MY HUSBAND CAME HOME WITH COVID. WHEN HE GOT BETTER WENT BACK TO WORK COME BACK HOME WITH COVID. I AM ANGRY AND CALLED HIS MEDICAL TEAM. I SAID NO ONE MENTIONED A RELAPSE IN THIS VIRUS. OUR GOVERNMENT DIDN'T TELL US THAT. DID I MENTION MY HUSBAND IS A VIETNAM VETERAN!! I HAVE A BEST FRIEND WHO I LOVE AND WOULD DO SO MUCH FOR IF I COULD. HE LIVES IN CHINA. OK ANYONE LISTENING THIS GOVERNMENT WE HAVE HAS NOT HELPED US AT ALL. NOW THEY WANT TO CUT US OFF WECHAT. I COMMUNICATE EVERY DAY WITH THIS FRIEND. THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A WAY TO CHAT AND IT IS NOT HURTING ANYONE.
I have used WeChat for about 5 years now and nothing is wrong with it. I use it to keep in touch with my family members in China. You can’t be banned unless you have violated the Terms of WeChat. Lastly to all of you brainwashed trump supporters get a life. As an Asian American I don’t want to lose contact with my family in China to some stupid accusations.
"I’ve been using WeChat for a very very long time now and I really like it. It’s convenient and easy to use. But the one thing that I hate is that ringtone you get every time someone calls you. Now this is a personal opinion, I wish they would let you choose or use your own ringtone cause that stock ringtone is genuinely annoying. But other than that, WeChat is a very good app. A lot better than WhatsApp in my mind."
I love it but want apple to unblock it. If you upgrade your IOS it will stop working in the US. I have no other way to contact my friends because they live in China and there is no other social web working which is so frustrating. It was our only way to communicate. The US government and apple should reconsider it.
"Is it perfect? Hardly. Are there privacy issues? Yes but this is not really anything new for anyone using the internet anywhere?

I really appreciate the fact that it is a reliable way to talk and interact with the Chinese Friends I made while they visiting my country. 

Would love to see a dark mode and a more simple way to export chat logs"
"I originally downloaded the app because I am doing a study abroad this coming year to China. But after not using the app for a few days it completely locked me out and said I was a security threat and have had suspicious activity . The worst part is that I need the app when I go to China. I have had over 20 people try to unblock my account 10 from mainland China and the app says they don’t meet the criteria to unblock me. BUT there is no criteria. I have also tried to contact customer support and they also are no help at all. Whatever they say on their help website,  will not work and is FALSE!!!!!!"
I have tried numerous times over several months to get this app and have been blocked for being suspicious. I have had others verify me without success. Hours have been wasted on trying to get this app and to get unblocked I can’t understand why this is such an issue. Meanwhile two of my children have been able to get this app working successfully. I would have given no stars since I can’t even use the app but that is not an option for leaving a review. I also cannot find a way to get customer service assistance. Ridiculous.
"I have this app on my IPhone and it works fine. Downloaded it to my IPad Pro to communicate with friends across the world. The video chat is sideways. When I turn the IPad where my friends are correct (and not sideways), I look funny because the camera is catching me at a different angle, so it doesn’t look like I am looking at them. I have tried every angle. Please fix this!!!
It’s useless if I can’t see the video the intended way. And I’m tired of looking at my little phone screen to see others in video chats."
"WeChat is the leading player among all Chinese chatting apps. The customer experience is much better than WhatsApp, FB Massager, Line, etc. 

Three shinning points regarding WeChat:

1) The communication experience is butter smooth. You can talk, type, video chat...

2) The WeChat Pay will makes you forget about your physical wallet. Ranging from big supermarket to small street-side grocery stores, almost all stores and markets in China accept Wechat Pay. 

3) The app it self has integrated numerous functions besides basic chatting and digital wallet. You can get DiDi (Chinese Uber), online shopping, buy air/train/bus ticket, order food, etc. Anything you want, Wechat will make it possible for you!"
"I have been update may wechat app tow days ago, it’s it’s really good Application but in I shake function All the characters are Chinese I would like to meet another religion like Arabic people because i am Arabic person , but so many shaking and I only get Chinese People I think I will quick from this application because it’s annoying me so much."
If you like to waste time then this is the app for you. I’ve been trying to sign up for an account for a week and I’ve never seen a more convoluted and broken process in my life. I’ve had no less than 5 people try to “verify my identity” and I still can’t get a login. It’s been the biggest waste of time and frustration. You’d think I was trying to steal state secrets when I just wanna chat with family stuck behind the great firewall of China. How this app has so many stars is a mystery to me. You’ll have better luck trying to rob a bank than you would signing up.
"This has to be one of the worst apps ever. It’s so terribly designed. You don’t even get an enter button to drop a line! And now it’s hijacking my Files app. Whenever I try to open a file (Word document for example) on my Files app it just opens WeChat and does nothing! I have to use 3D Touch to open in, it still goes to WeChat, but when I move back to the Files app the document is opened. Also, on the + sign next to the chat, the “Files” option just vanished out of nowhere. If it wasn’t a work tool for me I would never have installed this piece of terrible software."
"Tencent: why do you pretend to have customer service to waste my time writing about the problems I’m facing, while only giving me obviously pre-drafted universal feedbacks that prove no one ever actually read my reports. Also it’s sad knowing my opinion don’t mean anything because with such a big user pool and the monopoly of business, you still make tons of money although you treat customers as worthless. I hope you’ll know the day I die that you’re a part of what caused it, and it would me you feel something."
"my account has been blocked because it was inactive for about four and a half months. i only use the app to communicate with one person, an exchange student who went to my school the spring semester of 2017. we were very close friends and it was heartbreaking when she had to move back home, but there was some comfort in the fact that we could still talk and call on wechat. because we are both seniors this year, we’ve been very busy with school and have not had much time to talk, but i always relied on wechat to be there so i can talk to my best friend. it was the only way i could talk to her and now i cannot get into my account because i don’t know a number of any other wechat users. my friend’s birthday is coming up soon and i won’t be able to wish her a happy birthday. thank you wechat for making me lose touch with my long distance best friend. i will miss her so much."
"Wow. Today’s version update is finally offering users the ability to toggle between more than one account! Holy Jeeeeeeze!!!! I use a separate work account and I had been carrying around a second phone JUST for this work account. This new feature is much appreciated. 
I would give five stars if a next update would add an “unread message” notice on top of this feature."
"I hate wechat so much, this app stole my 3000 Malaysia ringgit, my bank account was linked to wechat and I got money inside just to wake up and find out my account was blocked 
What nonsense and I couldn’t find anyone to help me verify it out until now the wechat stole my monthly salary 😭😭
I will advice everyone to stay away from this app now"
"Thank you, WeChat Crew, this is such a great and improving app. It is a great way to communicate with your friends no matter what country you’re in and you get to post without having to go to Instagram or Facebook. Kids can use this app, adults can use this app, it’s a great app and I’m glad I have this app. They also have a collection of cute little wechat stickers!"
"When you meet a problem and needs help from the customers service or technical support, you will know how terrible this company is! I top up for WeChat out inside this App, but can’t spent the amount for over two weeks. I applied the form for customer service, but got a reply says there is no enough description please apply again. I don’t understand what kind of description can be ‘enough’. You have all my contact information, why don’t you contact me for any more ‘description’ you need? That shows their attitude toward customers!"
"Nearly perfect app but recently has been glitching out. My phone is brand new and ONLY has this issue in wechat. I use wechat for everything so this random glitch is frustrating, especially if I’m in public and need to do something quickly. Please fix and send out a new update. Last one was a month ago"
"When I use shake feature the phone it’s always don’t found a friends  ( to many attempts, try again later) it’s when I was have iPhone 5 , I was think the problem is with my phone , then I get a Sony XZ and still the same problem , and now i get iPhone  7 , and I still have the same problem ...."
"Downloaded the app, created an account, and was forcefully logged out almost immediately. Upon attempting to login to my account again, I received an error message stating my account was blocked. To unblock my account they require me to enter a WeChat user's phone number, so that they can verify my identity. I don't know anyone with WeChat yet. I was attempting to install this app to communicate with potential business partners, but it looks like I'll be sticking with Skype for now. 🙄 I sure wish all countries were permitted to access and utilize the WORLDWIDE web, including Facebook/Messenger."
"Please activate the message delivery receipt feature and read it by the receiving party, and indicate whether the person is online or offline, that is, the work of the program is similar to WhatsApp and Telegram. This feature is very important and I updated the program to the latest version and this feature did not appear. Please activate it…"
"When I turn on Do Not Disturb mode on my phone, screen locked, I would still receive incoming calls from wechat. I am using iPhone Se 2020 and iOS 13.4.1 and my friend with iPhone 8 on the same version of software is also experiencing this issue. Test it for yourself.
There was no way to type feedback within the app so I had to reach out through a review. I hope this gets resolved soon as being waken up at midnight is NOT fun."
"It’s a good app, literally all of China use it, but it’s so hard to make an account for me, because I don’t even have a phone, so I used my moms phone but I had to use a different phone number because she already has a WeChat, so I made a call free phone number, I went thru 3 people to “verify” my account (literally everyone in my house that has a wechat, just to see that... I can’t use a phone number from that app. :("
"Tencent behaves like it’s 2010, they bury Ad Personalization settings deep within the WeChat app, and do malicious things like sleep the server when trying to access and/or change the settings to enhance user privacy, and that page is only in Chinese language, even though the app is downloaded from the US App Store. 

In addition to obtaining user private data unethically and illegally, WeChat not only uses it to make money off of their users in an underhanded way, they provide it directly to the Chinese government. 

Terrible app."
"I have been using WeChat connecting with my family and friends in China. The popularity of the app always helps me finding long lost childhood friends. The app never crashed on me. Love all the chat functionalities. 

I will keep using WeChat as long as it is possible. We will not lose to THE Orange"
"Tried to sign up for this service so I see what it’s all about but it requires you contact someone else who already has the app to complete the registration process. This is, by far, the absolute worst and most asinine verification process I’ve ever come across. How about you just send me an SMS with a pin? Or have me do a captcha? Or take a snapshot of my driver’s license? Your app starts off by not just inconveniencing me but it is forcing me to inconvenience somebody else as well. What a shame. I was really excited to check this app out too. 😢💔"
"I am sorry to write down my dissatisfaction! I am also an old user of WeChat. Over the years, I have witnessed the growth of WeChat and its functions are more powerful. Whether it is WeChat payment or WeChat public account, etc., it makes people shine. However, WeChat is becoming more and more bells and whistles, approaching a software called QQ, and losing the original simplicity of WeChat, the adult world does not need such redundancy! I especially hope that, well, it is a suggestion, WeChat can stick to itself and keep the original intention."
"disadvantage:
1. wechat used up over 80G in my iphone 6plus memory. wechat is slow to react.  
2. wechat does not allow me to remove all group message if the group organizer somehow kick me out of the group. i have to delete the message one by one.
3. my wechat message is slow accepting message because it try to download every useless message from my 60 wechat groups . but i can not quit all these wechat groups due to family reason. my wechat is now accepting  messages 5days ago. I can not skip those historic messages. 
redicullous stupid"
"I have my Chinese bank card link to my wechat.  It was working fine until Wechat force users to summit personal ID info to them to enable my wechat Money.  For company likes Wechat, i do not feel safe sharing my personal identity info to them, so I am not able to use ~$500 that I have in Wechat.  It would have been more reasonable to have a transition period so I could withdraw my money out from Wechat before policy in place.  All my money is now stuck in Wrchat wallet, I will not trust Chinese company’s payment system any longer."
"Use it anywhere in the world. Video conference calls. Location sharing (offline / same time). So many nice & fun stickers. All in one app, been there for years, made our lives tremendously easier, until recently some other apps started to copy these features lol... It is just the best communication app out there to be honest."
"Wechat may be Chinese made, yet it is better by far than other communication systems. It is clear, easy to use, easy to join in friends and business partners. It is also very fast in sending photos and files effectively. I recommend Wechat to all people I meet around the world."
"The WeChat is popular and working, but several issues persist many versions. It still does not support iOS calling integration and strangely, rings even in iOS no disturb mode. When touch and hold an item in subscription it is still unfinished functionality shown. The developer needs to pay attention on details."
"There is no available option to unlink the mobile phone number on the account once you linked to it. Even after I linked my QQ ID to the WeChat account, wechat still don’t let me or show the option to let me UNLINk my mobile phone number from the account. What it said on the wechat app is that it only require one kind of linking security to the account, however it makes it like obligated and mandated to let wechat have the mobile number other than any kinds of linking methods. Wechat shoulda fix it."
"Everything ab the app is good, but just the videos that way too long to load. Unlike any other apps, there would always the pauses throughout EVERY video I click on. It includes videos sent from a friend or videos from moments. I hope wechat could fix this. It has been a issue for a very long time."
Just simply glad that it’s 9/20 and it’s still here. Finally someone can stop or suspend Donald Trump’s stupidity. 2020 is already tough enough. Cannot imagine how I would be able to keep touch with all my family and friends without WeChat. Countries’ tension should not hurt normal people’s lives I this way.
The problem I have with this app is trying to add the USA Visa/MasterCard which it doesn’t give the option. It only allows for Chinese bank cards. I cannot enjoy playing the red packet game to send or receive due to authorization of credit card that isn’t a Chinese bank. I also can’t even enter in a Chinese bank acct card and my regular debit/credit card in the US says it’s unsupported. The card function will need to be fixed!
I tried several ways to restore or reset my password.... Says my account is protected status. As close as I got was a screen that says to enter someone’s mobile number to verify me. Someone that has been on WeChat over 6 months....does not even need to be someone I know. How am I supposed to get someone’s cell phone number I don’t know that happens to be on WeChat oh and for longer than 6 months. I have tried several times to contact support with no reply. I have looked online and seems I am not alone with this issue
"I like wechat the problem is that when you sign in you have to get your friend to make you your contact so you can get in

I think you should just sign in without having to make your friends their contact to sign in because it took ages

Like after you sign in then you can get your friends contact"
"Ever since the most recent update, I had problems connecting to the server. The only way for me to get it to work is to uninstall the app and reinstall it again. I’ve done so 4-5 times in the past two days. When the app started to have that problem, backing your iphone to the iTunes doesn’t solve the problem. Once your iPhone is restored, WeChat still doesn’t work unless you uninstall and reinstall. So you are going to lose all the data in between."
Okay - so I saw this in my recommendations and decided to install it and give it a try and everything was going fine. That was until they said that I needed to get a friend to verify me? I find that stupid as I don’t have any friends who have wechat — especially for more than 1-6 months which is required. So if that’s the case - I need a random person to verify me and that’ll take days? That’s also just flat out stupid. Why can’t I just verify myself? This is by far one of the worst sign up methods in history.
"I would like to give a five star but a problem occured and its about whenever i turn on the loud speaker mode, The mic goes off and the person receiving the call can't hear what i am saying. So please fix the issue or help me understand whats the issue because my Mic works very well when its not on loud speaker."
"Ok so I have tried several times to create an account I am putting my true phone number I get it the part about verification, I ask a friend for help and the message they receive is that “this mobile number did not sign up request or the request has expired. That’s it ok so we try again still nothing. It’s like wechat just doesn’t want new users or something. Not even sure who I can reach to help solve this issue. I use wechat for a game a play and I need an app where I can translate."
"Guys seriously consider a redesign for the whole interface, make it dark or black. Plus it's easier to look at than plain white and it'll benefit people with OLED screens. And in my opinion most people would love this feature and if not just add a toggle so you can go from dark to white. And I have waited for Dark mode for Forever so please just do it."
"Moments, chats, and so much more to do, so cool! I use this app super often and I don’t know how am I supposed to be texting and calling my friends and family without this app. My family doesn’t have much social media apps and this is the only one all my family members have."
"Im in a lot of funny groups and other random groups, so when there is a new message in those groups, those group chats go up and hide the people i was talking to. It keeps annoying because there so many groups but i cant leave those groups. They really should separate group chats from private chats, like by adding another folder for group chats. Hope to see some changes, thanks"
"Not sure what happened but I made an account to keep in touch with a friend in China. Decided check in one day and my account had been closed or something? When I tried to get my account back with phone number verification, I got the text message to confirm but then it just went through a bunch of screens all in Chinese that ultimately didn’t allow me to get my account back. I was pretty reluctant to Dow load this app to begin with but after this, I’m deleting it and never downloading it again. Weird stuff."
"I downloaded this app just five months ago, I stop using it but now I need use the app again, but the support team says that I can’t use the app because my account is in danger, so they said that I need to make a procedure to recover my account, I have been trying to recover my account for almost a week and it was a waste of time because I can't get my account back, the procedure is giving the number of some friend who will help you to unlock your account, I still trying but nothing works. It seems like I lost my account forever 😠"
"Hello Developers 

I am so happy to use WeChat App. I wanna request please add the function: “ Manual selects delete my post or my moment” . Most of social app has this function. But WeChat have never had this function. I will hope to add please this function the coming update app. Thanks.😊"
"Theoretically, it’s just a chat app, something designed to let people talk to each other easily. But considering the ridiculous fact that you are using a chat app when you are not allowed to chat freely... under a ridiculous government control. People, you don’t need to complain about its poor customer service because it’s definitely not their focus. Next time if you want to draw their attention, simply try talking about some sensitive political issues. They will take you seriously then."
"Much better audio quality than it had before, but really wish you could set a unique sound for notifications instead of the standard iPhone text notification sound. 

It’s also used to be more stable, but recently seems to restart itself all the time, and sometimes it takes forever."
"The app automatically updated to the 7.0.12version. The whole app turned into dark mode right away. And there is NO OPTION to switch back.   

My whole world fell into endless darkness. The friend update are all black; the chat windows are all black! Oh and the conversation bubbles are neon green, which reminds me of the DOS world. 

Hey maybe the developers want to remind us that “basics are the new fashion”?

I understand that there is some benefit of the dark mode, such as power saving and eye protection. But please keep in mind that not all people like the dark mode and are willing to give up the regular mode (the white screen mode) for the so-called benefits. Please consider providing options to the users to choose what mode they want.  A lot of users will thank you for this consideration."
"I downloaded this because my friend asked me to, and after less than a week my account was suspended for “suspicious activity”, so I had to ask my ONE FRIEND to help me log in. It was frustrating, but it worked in the end. Then, a week later, my friends account got suspended. So she asked me to help her log in, and it tells me I can’t since my account was suspended in the past year. On top of that, it really drains my battery. So you’d do much better looking for another messaging app, this one just kicks you out for no reason."
I bought a new phone phone. When I logged in it asked for devin authorization to get( I never asked for this) I did not have a friend I could call to agree or my old phone to scan to get in. I emailed WeChat 3 x about this for help to fix it and no response. I use to use  this app to speak to a old friend of mine who moved over seas. I can no longer contact him. Poor customer service and not sure why I can’t get in even if my password was correct needing a second authorization.
"Hi I have problem for my WeChat. Today, my WeChat screen just keep loading and can’t let me to reply any message, every time it show “network error” & “disconnected” well but my network is pretty well and only WeChat can’t use so I really don’t know what is this problem hope can reply soon🙏🙏🙏"
"Only got it once i moved to china, but now i know why its life here. Easy. And we can do everything with it!  Why is this not used so widely in America!  I love the easiness of everything: pay phone bill, pay electric bills,  use as a credit card at basically all shops, and make it easy to send friends money"
"WeChat, is a kind of Good App, but now they just block it any how, I have registered more than 7 accounts in 5 months they just keep blocking them for no reason, now I want to delete this app out of my phone, or you guys should do something about the WeChat App especially in Africa, you guys have to do something about it, they just keep blocking everyone account, it really got me mad🥵🥵"
"i had an account and it said it had been too long since the last time i logged into it,  (about a year) s o i needed to make a new account. i made a new account and it won’t load the security verification page, so i CaN’t UsE wEcHaT, which is really really really annoying. please fix this bug because i really enjoy using wechat"
"Accidentally deleted all chat history when reinstalling app/exchanging to new phone etc. very frustrating!!! Please please enable cloud storing all chat history. 

Also would be nice to have a way to start listen voice message from any point user can drag to, instead of starting from beginning every time."
"Wechat is like a combination of Facebook and message, Snapchat and Wallet. Easy to use. You could post your stories, chat with friends, create groups and left message to friends that they could listen when they are free. In China you don’t even need to bring a wallet if you have wechat. Very great app."
"1. Color theme. Please add it because many young people would like it. It doesn’t have to have tons of different theme. 5 is enough to keep it neat and functional.

2. Notification Sound. The one now is really boring and I’ve heard it for so many years. Please add one or two more fancy ones because girls(like me) would love it a lot!!"
"I think one of the improvements it can make is adding feature like Messengers that people can give emoji sticker comments for specific messages or sentences on top of the message itself, instead of only giving emojis as another message after that specific sentence..."
"Lived in China for 20 years where wechat is the masterpiece of communication. Arriving in US, using whatsapp, google, Viber, skype,  They are so poor in terms of integration of functions like payment, saving of favorites video and photo transfer; wechat is unbeatable in terms of speed of file transfer."
"Does a lot... terrible to operate. Why is there no better way to switch between different functions?
Need to go back back back back to reach a text so I can copy something and go forward forward forward forward to past... not a good user interface 

Also... why a green which is different from messages and WhatsApp. I have them in a group and it just looks ugly"
"This app is highly demonized because it’s based in China and it allegedly collects data but you have to keep in mind that Facebook, google, Apple, etc. all these apps we 100% know collect data for their users and spy on people. So I just wrote this to get word out about the double standard."
I just got an account here and the next day it got blocked. The account was for an interview for a job I was hoping to get and because I wasn’t able to communicate they didn’t give me a second chance. I don’t know why my account was under suspicion and because of this I lost my job. I don’t appreciate the fact that this app ruined my chance for a job with no evidence because I made an account the day previous. The only reason I got on was for business and it wouldn’t even let me do that.
The verification methods on this app are so stupid. The first time I signed up it said I needed a friend to verify my account because of suspicious activity...First of all how do I have suspicious activity on my account when I just opened it and second of all I don’t have any friends on this account that I just created. But before all of that I needed to verify my account by solving s puzzle and texting a number. Why do I need to do this to create an account? Absolutely ridiculous. Hate this app.
"I got this app so I could use it when hangouts shut down, it was good at first, you could change the background on the chat, have a global profile, meet new people, but then I got randomly banned for no specified reason! And when I tried to have someone else to unban me, it said their profile had to exist for more than 6 months? ( this happened within a week of first getting the app) I definitely will not use this app until it unbans me or gives me the reason why I got banned"
"Downloaded this because I had to contact someone who is someplace where WhatsApp is blocked. Followed instructions to register and it says there is some suspicious activity and does not allow to login. I have to contact someone having a 6 month old account to login, It seems sms verification is not enough. During all this the app language for sometime changed to what I believe was Chinese even though I gave a US no.  Waste of time and effort. Wish could have given zero stars."
"I love this app! You can chat, call, and even video chat with all kinds of stickers! You can talk to people from all over the world and make friends and they won’t send you friend suggestions all the time like FB, more private!"
Downloaded app for the first time. Set up my account. Went to add people and it tells me my account has suspicious activity and is blocked. Never even got to add the people I wanted to be able to communicate with while out of the country. Multiple emails have gone unanswered. Account is still blocked. No reason to worry with it anymore since the people I needed to communicate with are already out of the country traveling.  Best of luck for those who need this app. I hope it will work for you!
"I downloaded the app and have started creating an account. Honestly excited for making friends and connecting with others. But when I try to make an account, I need a fellow user to “verify” me. 
To make friends or meet ANYONE on the app, I first need to get the app. You can not find anyone on the app until you are allowed to use it. Very frustrated, and disappointed. 
Don’t download the app, it’s a waste of time and energy. If I could give it 0 stars I would."
"Everything works great! And if you live in China, this app can help you do almost everything—from communication to payment. But if you watch 18:9-ratio videos posted by official accounts horizontally, black bars are around all 4 corners of your screen. This was not a issue before until they updated their WeChat video player recently."
"Wechat helps us a lot when we are alone far away from home, for those local people they may never feel that same emotion. F the trump our president, I think his wife should face the same as we did."
