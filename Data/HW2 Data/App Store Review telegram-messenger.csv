"OVERALL If you’re tired of companies like facebook reading your messages, yes they really do, it’s time to up your game. Telegram and Signal are both great apps, Telegram being a bit easier, and polished. Telegram chats use two modes. In standard mode messages are encrypted and stored on their servers. In “padlock” mode messages are encrypted and stored on your device. Both are secure, however in “padlock” mode if you, for instance, buy a tablet and install Telegram it won’t show your messages from other devices. Remember, enable touch ID on your phone/iPad/macOS device and Telegram, otherwise anyone could physically access the device and read your conversations. SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENT FOR DEVS It could use one improvement, when you share via iOS it needs to have both the standard AND a “padlock” icon for secure chat. Otherwise you’ll end up with two different chats with each friend. Until then you need to select share, Telegram, and manually pick the right chat.

Also, make the “read” checkmark color customizable or bold. Or better use an “o” for unread and a check for read."
"Hey, I’ve been using Telegram for over 10+ years and I haven’t had any problems with this application whatsoever everything works great but, there is one issue that I have with this application and that is the inability to create a group video chat that is why I can only give telegram 3 stars. I honestly believe that is a crucial disadvantage to this application I say that because, I have family and friends that live all over the world whether it be in different states or different countries and we all have telegram on our phones. That being said we would like to I’ll be able to talk in a video group chat with each other which we are unable to because this application doesn’t provide that option. So therefore since telegram doesn’t provide a video group chat option we have to download another application to be able to do that Task. Which in my opinion is extremely ridiculous because you should be able to perform the test on this app as well. Instead of making people waste valuable space on their phones by download in other apps to perform the test where y’all can provide that ability on your app so we don’t have to download other apps to perform that and we could save space on our Devices."
"I am enjoying telegram as my main chatting app as it’s secure faster & fun to use! But unfortunately it has only voice calling feature which makes me to use another apps for that feature only! I cordially expect that developer will add that asap! 

It’s passcode locking feature in order to provide best security to its user, but apps lock doesn’t work immediately! Which should be must! The minimum time is 1 minutes! It should be locked within a fraction of second as some other apps do! As long as we have face unlocking feature so it will not bother us! 
Lastly, I have facing an unexpected issue sometimes! I’m not sure where I tap but when it happens telegram stop functioning & start glitching non stop glitching! It needs the apps to launch again! 
So please make the apps more lovely by adding video calling features and make the passcode lock more quicker & fix the bug! Thanks for reading with patience!"
"The genuine telegram app deletes text messages from both sides but the third party apps keeps those messages and that is not good because it invades the peoples privacy status and sometimes they have the whole conversation sent to others even if it was confidential, for example if you saved a wrong number and then wrote a text or sent a photo then realized that its the wrong account and deleted it but yet if that person is using the “ third party apps” then he will still have those texts, photos, and user information and for me that is a major flaw in your agreement to them. I wish you can fix that problem or get rid of those apps and save other peoples sanity. 
Overall I love the Genuine app its so slick easy and so much comfortable to use I have been using it for the past 3 & 1/2 years and it never let me down. Keep up the good work and please check your agreements with the third party apps.
Thanks in advance"
"Look I’m a big fan of this app I used like a few years ago and now it’s at a whole different state and it’s so much better then WhatsApp and now with their new update about privacy most the people I know don’t know about technology stuff and change logs but I do so I’ve gotten a handful of people to switch and a few friends and family and they’ve all said they love this app and it’s true it’s awesome but they won’t delete WhatsApp because it’s missing, stories or a status a way to let others know about you including myself I now have 2 messaging devices I use telegram as my main and WhatsApp I use it for school and status if you could add this it would mean a lot to me I’ve heard you just hit 500 mil🥳 and I feel good to have been a part of that I know it may take a while for you too implement this feature but it would be the death of WhatsApp for all the people I’ve invited"
"My S.O. and I have been looking for the perfect secure video chatting platform for a while. We were pleasantly surprised that Telegram finally started implementing video chatting. It is very buggy at the moment, but Telegram is definitely on the right track and has everything that we are looking for. We use the group video call feature to share screens and audio, and it’s very easy to seamlessly switch devices without having to disrupt the call. The iOS app seems more buggy than desktop as it overheats and freezes up my phone during long calls. Other bugs include recursive screen-in-screens during screen sharing, hearing your own voice when sharing audio, and suddenly not hearing the other person. It also would be great to have these features in the individual voice chats as well. Overall, we’re very excited for these features and the quick updates."
"Positives: Telegram had some positive features. You can start a secret chat with someone. There’s freedom of speech in that app and you can say politically incorrect things without getting banned. You can post content which are deemed offensive. That’s why I like Telegram. I do miss the app, though. Unfortunately, I can’t go back, not after what happened to me. 

Negatives: I was catfished by a scammer. The problem with Telegram is that it doesn’t have a report feature. I reported the scammer via using Yahoo mail, Gmail, and even messaged notoscam. Sadly, Telegram wouldn’t do anything about it. I had to delete my account, and deleted the app itself because of how persistent and dangerous the scammer is. The scammer is using a photo of an actual doctor and is pretending to be him. I suspect it’s an African scammer, but I’ll never know. The only thing I had done was to block the scammer on Telegram, but that wasn’t enough."
"I am on a mission to get as many people away from the tentacles of Zuckerboss as possible. Have managed to get a few dozens of people to switch from whatsflop to this better platform. The only complain I get is that this does not have status, which apparently social media junkies can’t live without 🤦🏻‍♂️ Another complain is that the app freezes or acts slow in low connection spots some thing those users of whatsflop supposedly didn’t deal with it. Hopefully these things will be addressed and improved/fixed. I know this is still evolving and growing so I am hopeful it would become the dominant messaging platform and I will contribute to that by getting people to jump ship. I only hope we don’t get sold out like all these other money hungry corps out there. Keep up the good work guys, I wish you great success in the years to come 👍🏼👍🏼"
"I have had Telegram for a few years. I installed it because some contact mentioned that they use is for communication just like many other of global contacts who use various different Apps for communication and I download them to make it easy for my contact to reach me. I have about 11 such apps and Telegram is the only App that will intermittently big me with notifications that someone in my contact list has joined Telegram and other silly alerts that have noting to go with me receiving a message from a contact. I just received 11 notifications back to back that 11 of my contacts joined Telegram. First of all it’s not a coincidence that 11 different people who have nothing in common other than being in my contact list join Telegram at the very same second. So obviously, this is a cheap way of Telegram trying to engage with me. I seriously don’t give a crap who is in or not. If they are and they need to reach me then and only then I’d like to be alerted. Kindly fix your unnecessary alerts or give me the option of what alerts I’d like to get and I’ll change my ratings for you."
"In this day and age video calling is a must with every app such as Telegram, and lack of it unnecessarily opens the door for the competition. Despite my desire to solely use Telegram to connect with friends & family all over the world, I’m having to use other apps, because of the lack of this feature in this app, and I’m sure this is the case for most of its other users.
I’d give this app 4 stars if it had the video calling feature, and 5 if it wasn’t for some other malfunctions I come across every now and then, such as, all of a sudden losing all my communications with a contact from the beginning till a random date, or altogether till the present! This has happened to me several times with different contacts, so I highly recommend backing your communications up if they’re important to you. 
I really hope, and strongly suggest that the developers add the video calling feature ASAP. 
Thank you for all your efforts for providing the public with a great communication tool! 🙏🌹"
"The customizable colors, dark theme, sleek, fluid messaging app, private, and secure. Destructible messages are a plus. I like the spoiler option it’s pretty cool, along with many other features.

 Previously Telegram was lacking video calls, Group Video Calls, FaceID. I’ve noticed they added it on which is great!

 End to End encryption should be standard. Why go through the hassle of doing secret chats? The option should be the other way around “unsecret chats” 

Please add Pin Numbers. Some people dont like to share phone numbers. Having the option for Pin number to add users on Telegram is a Marvelous idea. 

More business features are needed like having the capability to pay and receive payments within the app. Having an online store. 

 Add a “transparent theme” for themes and colors that be awesome! 

 One thing needs FIXING. The app has been updated. Now it’s complicated and confusing to change the color themes. When applying the colors and theme it does not update it.

 Someone sent me a voice note. It took 12 hours to receive it. The voice note stayed at a downloading state the whole time. I have 5G service. 

Please update with new features suggested and fixes. Then we can agree it deserves a 5 Star rating. Im sticking to 4 stars until then."
"***Disclaimer*** 
This is only describing the various situations where forex group chats exist on the service. Nothing against the actual service itself, only the Forex groups on the app
***Disclaimer***

So the app is wonderful in terms of communication, and a good competitor to Whatsapp (another wonderful messaging service). My only beef is the fact that I was the idiot (last October) to download the app due to being suckered by a rando online about a bitcoin forex. I was unaware of such financial lingo, assuming that I would get my return profit in 48 hours. 

Biggest mistake

If people recommend you to various places that offer a return profit via forex, DO NOT EXPECT MONEY BACK IMMEDIATELY. You’ll only lose your money due to the highly volatile nature of not only Bitcoin, but also Forex itself is essentially a bigger gamble due to various international markets operating around the clock. Whether it be through Facebook or any other social media accounts, you cannot be suckered by such things. It’s a pandemic and the last thing one should want is to lose money. 

It’s precious and you should not let your emotions control the wallet. Ones intellect and wise choices dictates money. So if you’re looking to save money, do the research, be financially literate, and save the money. 

Nothing against this app once again, but the groups who promise for get rich quick schemes."
"I enjoy using the app much more than any other social media messaging platform. The ability to create group chats, call people, and customizable features in addition to a UI that is seamless with other devices, and doesn't stutter is a treat.

 But, in some areas telegram falls short due to lack of video messaging, the traffic seems to be lower than other platforms, and searching for groups isn't as easy as some may like it to be. Regardless, a video chat feature similar to instagrams live mode would be perfect for the group chats. If possible maybe even allowing features thats on discord to be on the app, better bots would be a plus that telegram makes themselves rather than relying on other people bots. Most bots seem to not work as well as the competition. 

Overall its a great 1 v 1 app, but apps such as WhatsApp or instagrams video-calling is superior, and discords bots and chat customization is superior. Telegram is the perfect middle ground that could do better."
"Pretty much everything WhatsApp has and more. Not to mention, actually good security—unlike WhatsApp. End to end encryption where the keys are kept on your device. If you do some research, Telegram’s security has been publicly audited by real world events. 
I work in cyber sec and use Telegram as my default messenger for everything. Whether it’s sending large files (seriously, I’ve sent files over a gigabyte) to joining a variety of channels/groups. I honestly believe Telegram could be the next IRC chat (I get all my security and tech news and updates from telegram channels faster than news sites or rss). 
I’ve been slowly converting my friends and family to it. Simply the best and the features just keep coming. Thank you Telegram developers! You’ve truly revolutionized decentralized messaging."
"When I scroll the files/links shared with someone, and this person sends me a message, I do not receive the notification, and the message is considered as read like being within the chat. (which I actually am, but in another tab)

I checked that on Windows, Linux and different Apple devices. It is not the issue on tablets, as the display is separated, neither on desktops, if user widens the window so that the chat and files/links are present concurrently. However on cellphone devices only chat or files/links tab can be displayed at a time.

I guess it will be better to notify the user whenever they do not actually see the message with a topside pop-up and show the label “unread messages” within the chat when user is back from files/links tab."
"I logged out from one of my accounts and since then This app doesn’t work. All it shows is a white page. I tried restarting my phone but it didn’t help and no I don’t wanna redownload it because that will erase all of my data. The most annoying thing about an app would be this kind of losing data and you know what? This is not the first time. Sometimes with the new updates I had this problem again. In my country I can say that we pay A LOT for using internet and I’m just sick and tired of wasting it on redownloading things that I didn’t even wanted to be erased in the first place. [ and also more importantly it’s just so frustrating and time consuming ]
Since it’s impossible to avoid all this kind of mistakes, in the future updates please add “mass downloading” which can offer us redownloading all the latest data we downloaded on our other devices or lost all together."
"I am visually impaired, and I use Voice Over to navigate through the various features on my IPhone 8. I am using the most current version of IOS 13. I can only use Voice Over when listening to a single contact (I can activate the play button). But when I try to activate the play button when chatting within a group, Voice Over does not work. Instead, I have to turn Voice Over off and activate play like a user who is sighted. I fortunately have enough vision to do this, but a blind or visually impaired person with less or no vision would not be able to perform the work around I have found. I have tried to report this several times, and I have received no feedback at all. I find that to be very discouraging. I know that some blind useds are experiencing the same problem while others are not, so it is not an across the board problem. However, the issue still needs to be invchstigated."
"It’s really an awesome app. More developed, practical, helpful and simple. I believe it will be more powerful and helpful for those who have wide range businesses and need to reply to their clients with same instructions for repeated question by providing Telegram with “Quick Replies” service. Quick Replies can have a table with replies and we can call the table inside any chat by starting our reply with a symbol such as “/“ to bring the list of replies we have already to choose one quickly.

Also, it will be powerful if you add “Auto Reply Message”. Auto Reply Message will be sent to those clients who text us for the first time. This message can contain information about our business and some general instructions to help the once who text us for the first time.

Thank you."
"I truly love it, I wanted to try a new app for texting and this is perfect. It has great privacy features, you can customize it in a lot of ways, and it works perfectly. I only have a small suggestion that may not be as important, but it would be a great improvement. 

I imported a chat from another app, and as soon as I saw hundreds of messages arriving, I regretted it. I want to delete them, but Telegram does not allow to select many messages really fast to delete them, you have to tap them one by one to select them. It would be great if it allowed users to select multiple messages faster, or if it had an option to delete imported messages in an specific chat just in case the user regrets it.

But overall, a really great app, I recommend it."
"Telegram was almost bug free, but version 5 introduced a host of new bugs that were previously fixed. 1) ""Last seen"" time is no longer accurate. It takes a few minutes to update. Often it tells me that I was last seen 30 minutes ago, when I'm online! 2) the search feature is broken: it has the glitch that only shows 100 results maximum. Previously it used to tell me how many messages each person sent to the chat, which was in the tens of thousands. Now each person has allegedly only sent 100 messages. 3) The same old message notification keeps being pushed to my Notification Center after I've cleared it from there multiple times. This happens for days at a time for the same notification.

EDIT 12/19: Developer mentioned the update, well issue 1 was not fixed with the recent update that was pushed out. However, I can report that issue 2 has been fixed. Still noticing issue 3, and will email about it. Thanks"
"Telegram has been a great application which i have been using for more than 6 years non-stop! But lately i have switched to ios and i am short on storage. Whenever i clean the cache, the number in the app goes down but in my settings the numbers will not change that much. So every time i am supposed to delete the app and re-download it so i will lose all my secret chats. Also being able to delete messages of the other person for both sides?! This is not new but it is so bad. I mean imagine you are talking to an online shop, you send the receipt but they will delete it later and deny that you have paid! I hope you make changes and solve these problems. I think these are the only downsides that i can mention for this wonderful app. Thank you."
"It is safe and secure with the option of end-to-end encrypted messaging, easier and more user friendly than whatsapp. The new version has video call as well. I call my friends around the world for free. Channels are great and recently added options to leave comments and pin more than one messages are great features and it comes with a desktop version to use everything on your computer as well.

Overall, I prefer telegram to whatsapp.

Note to new users: don’t delete your messages to release storage on your phone, instead, learn to clear your telegram cache.

To the developers team: I think including sliding bar on the voice messages would be good. Also an option to lock the voice recorder on the desktop version similar to the mobile. Please keep expanding video calls to do meetings in groups. And finally, it would be great to add personal folders to saved messages, I use telegram as my favorite quick note app as well! because it is easy and has a user friendly format plus desktop so it can also be used as a personal note taking app and if you add folder options to saved messages, it will make a great tool! Thanks."
"The Feb. 3 update still includes the really annoying bug.  To test the new update, I typed ""This is a test of Telegram's new updated app.""  Here is what Telegram got:  ""Thisi atTelegram's nbew pda app.""  Clearly, this is still completely unusable.  If anything, the number of dropped characters is worse than it was originally.

Original review:
Updating to the latest version introduced a really bad bug that causes keyboard input to get corrupted.  When I type on my Bluetooth keyboard now, Telegram acts like I also typed random backspaces every few characters, completely messing up the words I type, and inducing auto-correct to change many of the messed-up words to something completely different.  Please fix this right away!
I've installed every update since the bug was introduced, and none of them have addressed the problem!  I just updated again today (Jan. 9), and the problem is as bad as ever.  I have to type very slowly and constantly correct Telegram's mistakes, making it nearly unusable."
"I love telegram, a friend put me onto the app. It's nice for dating when you don't want to give out your number or socials to stay discreet. You can only voice call no video call.. I don't mind though, you can send videos, pictures and voice messages. But they took away timed photos/videos. That was my FAVORITE feature, it's like Snapchat if I want to send a video or picture I could time it... But I can't anymore, please bring feature back. It seems like every single update they take away a great feature, I shouldn’t have to download something on my computer to sign into a new phone , I know it makes you guys think you’re being secure but it’s making it more complicated.... bout ready to say a few this app and go to WhatsApp , not everyone has a computer they can concurrently download on just to sign in on a new phone . Like come on do better"
"Telegram does a lot of things right, but its total lack of customization of usability settings isn’t one of them.

“Raise to listen“ is forced on. Any random time something comes close to your phone, it decides you’ve raised it to your head and starts a voice recording. There’s a secret debug menu (not mentioned anywhere) accessed by tapping “settings” 10 times, but even turning it off there doesn’t fix it. 

This breaks when more since circle videos autoplay — a conversation with them means you’ll constantly be going back to watch someone’s that you missed, and then *your* video after will play. Possibly at double their volume. And you’ll have to stop it manually, every single time. 

But what’s worse is that if any circle video is paused, and there’s play/pause on the top bar, then raise to listen will override and play *no matter what*. Even if you have it forced off in the secret debug menu. 

For every hour of circle video conversation, this means manually stopping autoplay and having to hit the little X literally hundreds of times just to make your own recordings not play loudly at you, and your phone’s sensor not delete what you were recording because a cat got too close to your phone and it decided it was your ear. 

All because Telegram really, *really* doesn’t like giving you options as to how you use the app."
"I love this app, have used it every day for the last year. It is powerful and elegant. The one big drawback is the SEARCH. How do you search for Groups and Channels? By searching for a keyword. That’s it. Not good! Everyone says this is the achilles heal, and it’s weird that the issue has never been resolved. Here’s a suggestion for the developer. Add a feature of searching for Groups/Channels by allowing the owner to place their G/C into CATEGORIES (such as “health”, “food”, etc) then everything search related, falling into those categories, is displayed by title. Keep the Keyword searches, just add this capability. There are groups on Telegram that were formed specifically to allow owners to ADVERTISE their group, in order to grow, because the search feature is so inadequate. Please address this issue. And thanks for a great app. 👍🏻"
"I love the idea of this app and I love that it has polls, rules set, bots, and other things but my app crashes 100% of the time when ever I go into settings to check out the “Masks”. It just kicks me out the app than when I look for stickers there’s only a few compared to what others claim they have (I’m only seeing a little when others have and see a lot more options than me) and I’m unable to find Chatrooms. The only option I have is to open messages to chat with someone but I want to go to a chatroom. Not chat with someone. Someone said I’m fully missing the icon (a magnify glass) and only have the box with a pencil which is for starting a new message with someone. Can this be fixed soon? I just download the app three days ago. So there isn’t any updates I’m neglecting to update when it says the last update was two week ago. Someone mind helping?"
"Hey dev team, the auto save feature for all media (images specifically) isn’t working since I updated to publicly available ios 12. It worked perfectly on all betas of iOS 12 and stable versions of previous iOS but now it became very frustrating as I expected to see all images received to be in photo gallery but aren’t being saved for some reason.
I tried reinstalling both Telegram and iOS, tested telegram on 3 different iPhones but nothing seem to be helpful in this case.
Media auto save is enabled in settings and app has access to photos so no permission issues as far as I understand.
I also sent a message to app support few weeks ago and never head back from them so this is the last step before I start looking for alternatives.
Another big issue is calls quality/reliability. Every time I call someone after few min I hear beeps that indicate lost/poor network, then I can hear other party again but they can’t hear me or call just drops after 15-20 seconds. The longer the call (multiple calls) is the more often it breaks and I have to call that person again.
I’m on latest iOS 12.0.1 and iPhone XS Max 256.
Hoping to see these two fixed in the next update.
Once this and dropping calls is fixed Telegram will be again my favorite messenger. Until then - 2 star review."
"Hi telegram developers, I noticed a problem after your last update, it's about when i download a song and try to listening to it after 2 or 3 times in repeat mode music stops playing ,but in lock screen i have it ,and shows that music is playing but nothing played and music player is terminated , then i have to reopen the telegram and play it again and again by the way when you are in the app everything works properly, this problem shows itself when you’re going to lockscreen or open another app when telegram is in background, telegram last 2 updates are more reliable than this version and it’s really annoying specially behind the wheel or when i put on my handsfree, i hope developers fix this bug to make it the best social app like the past . (iPhone 7plus)

Best regards"
"I rlly like telegram. Its the best messaging app in my opinion. Has everything that i need in a messaging app, secure ,safe, easy and fast and very amazing in general! Has so many options for everything. And is totally worth loading!!! I been using it for the past 5 years and its totally my number one app for everything! But only one complain i have for the newest update: when i edit a photo on the app , like drawing on it or just changing the appearance of the pic, the app crushes and goes to my home screen, its been happening ever since i updated telegram and i just want you guys to fix that, other than that the app is amazing and works perfectly fine! Thanks for making the best app ever!!!"
"I absolutely enjoy this app. I’ve had it for years and I find it so much easier to use than any other social media outlet out there. It’s safe, the end-to-end encryption is phenomenal, and the app itself allows me to talk to so many of my friends that I have around the world. Apple removing it from the App Store is absolutely ridiculous and stupid. Telegram has done nothing wrong, and if they did I want to see the encryption proof. There’s no reason those with IPhones should have to lose the ability to talk to their friends on a stream line platform simply because “it violated Apple’s guidelines”. It’s ridiculous and I am keeping my Telegram on my IPhone whether apple likes it or not!"
"The app is quite good but I gave it 3 stars because it’s notifications feature is horrific. I absolutely loathe apps that don’t respect my notifications preferences and this one in particular doesn’t like to suppress the very annoying ones that come in every single time someone in my contacts list joins Telegram. I really don’t care to know who joins the service from my contacts every time it occurs. Turning this notification off does not from stoping them from continuing to arrive in-app, and the only way to stop this is to turn off Notifications in my phone’s global settings, but doing so will make one forego notifications that I do care about, such as from new messages. It’s baffling they choose to force users have to deal with this, it’s the one thing that’s making me consider leaving the app altogether."
"Hi telegram is one of the best communication apps out there but the ownership of channels and groups is a pain in the neck really, i have bought a channel from an admin and she claimed that she owns the channel i had no idea about owner stuff and that you can transfer the ownership of channels until it was late, she by mistake made someone admin with her other account just when i thought she had left the channel with her both accounts when i demanded an answer she refused stubbornly to do so, so i did a research and found out that iam just an admin despite paying huge amount of cash and now she refuses to co operate but can get back at any time and kick me from moy own chhannel i wrote to telegram support saying i have all the vidence that i paid money to this guy and chat records are there too but they didnt answered back 😞😔 it seems that there is no hope for me..."
"I received a 2nd email regarding an interview for a job I applied to.  I am a recovering stroke victim, so I haven’t been able to work in almost 6 years, but recently decided to take a leap and find a remote job, as I can’t drive at the moment.
This afternoon I received an email, in regards to a job I applied to.  I quickly forwarded to onto my husband and he pointed out right away that it was sent from someone with a “Gmail” address and not a company email, which was the first red flag.  It goes onto say I would be interviewing with this guy and said the virtual interview would take place at this platform.  Ok, I have never heard of such place.  The like had his name spelled without an “s”, which I found to be another Red Flag.
My husband texted me back a screenshot of a scam done on behalf of this company (using this company name) and on this platform.
I tried reporting this persons account, but was unsuccessful, as apparently this platform is run by volunteers.
I just want to see this persons account shut down.  I tried searching this person on LinkedIn and couldn’t find any matches.  I tried searching without the “s” and still no searches.
I contacted the company and the lady told me they are not hiring for remote jobs, only on-site and apologized.  She said no one by the names I gave her worked for the company.
I immediately deleted this app and will be more careful in the near further."
"I like app, a lot. I can group chat with friends, or get lost in the wilds with foreigners and weirdos, so a plus in my book

The only bad I can say with this app, lies not with its developers, but with Apple and the AppStore. I’ll find channels with discourse of all varying opinions. Something I find refreshing. But I’ll then go to revisit, only be prompted that the channel is blocked due to violations of AppStore guidelines. There is no violation. It’s Apple using its corporate mass to silence opinions it seems as bad. 

Because of this, I will NEVER use or buy another Apple product. Once this phone dies, that’s it. Anything but an Apple. ANY other phone. A product and company, that keeps me from viewing content that I sought out myself, should never even make it to market"
"I love the new update but there are 2 minor glitches to it. 

1. The Telegram app doesn’t really synchronize all my contacts. I save the contacts with the names but then after a while the name stops showing up at the top of the conversation bar. Instead of showing the name I saved the contact with, the number shows up there like I haven’t saved the contact at all until I close the app and open it back. Then it fix for some couple meeting showing the name and then exposing the contact number again. And if I go to data and storage in the setting tab to delete cache for some contacts I can’t see most of the contacts that I saved. So I think that’s it about contact synchronization.

2. The badges for new messages is sometimes deceiving I read and reply to a message but the new message badge doesn’t go away both inside the app and on the icon on my Home Screen. I also have to close the app and open it back before the already read badge goes away. If I don’t close the app and then reopen the badge would just stay there even after reading all the unread messages and replying to them. 

Fix this 2 things on the next update and you’ll have my 5 star review. Thank you."
"I like the App, it has a lot of features, but couple of things are missing compare to other Apps: 1) Group video calls. 2) Using system contacts photos, Signal App uses this feature and it’s great, makes it easier to find contacts specially for those who don’t use photos in their profiles or use random ones, so let the App uses my own contacts photo!

Bugs need to be fixed: 1) notifications don’t work properly, sometimes you get the message previews on lock screen and sometimes nothing. 2) in group chats sometimes it doesn’t say who sent the message or media, no name tag shows. And I think you should add the senders name on every single message, not just the last one! It’s really annoying and confusing trying to figure out who sent what!
Thanks"
"This is my BEST APP so far!! I love how fast it is, and hod’s much information it gives. Things such as when a person is online, when a person was last seen, and when something had been delivered and read. It also gives you the chance to delete something you regret, or didn’t mean to send. The sticker sets are free and fun, and I much prefer them to emojis. You can make your OWN profile, so that you can choose what picture others see, and what name. I don’t really have any feedback, or anything to fix, but I think it would be cool if you could change font and colors on the app, instead of downloading an entirely new app. Overall, this is an amazing, secure app."
"There’s a couple privacy settings that aren’t provided that probably should be. For starters you can’t add a decoy phone number which essentially negates any purpose of having the app in the first place. Secondly, even if you don’t give Telegram access to your contacts, if someone on your contacts starts using Telegram they will automatically be added to the contacts screen in the app as well as prompt a conversation with them in the chats screen, this is especially bad if you’re, let’s say trying to use the app to contact someone who you can’t contact through discord anymore and you’re also trying to hide a certain aspect of your life from family members like an aunt who just so happens to start using that while you have your account completely exposing the part of your life you want hidden."
"Hello, I just want to express how unhappy I am with the fact that we can’t choose if the app sends alerts to our contacts that we are using the app. Why can’t we just use an app without letting our whole contact list know? This is a huge drag and the reason why I deleted the app years back and why I al going to delete it soon, I clearly do not necessarily want all my contacts to be alerted that am using an app, the second I started using after 2 years I have messages coming in from random people. I am here just for some channels my friend recommended me but now I have to be texting people or be rude and ignoring messages because they received a notification and in the app they now exactly when am or was online. THUS IS BEYOND ANNOYING. I have now to consider getting a new sim card just to be able to use the app without having people invading me."
"This is my go-to messaging service. Security, speed, functionality, and fun features are all here. 

There are a few downfalls to the platform, such as groups being a little clunky to create if you do not have the people you are adding to the group in your contacts, no video calling, needing to use your phone number to make an account, etc., but these are all minor issues with an otherwise superb service that is always being improved. It’s great to be able to send a file and not have to worry too much about file transfer limits, like on Discord. 

Since the standard Telegram app became telegram X, I found one bug- most of my sticker packs will not correctly load, and will be unusable. That’s the only bug I’ve encountered so far."
"Amazing everything!! Fluid of the program: perfect! Design: beautiful and friendly user, chooser friendly of options, aka dark theme. There’s so much choices and I am amazed by the themes and choices they have. Program: runs as fluid as a slippery butter on a pancake, it is fantastic. Encryption technology software?: Beats Facebook messenger to the rocks. Safety?: As safe in no penetration of Russian bots migrating like Trojans. Clear and safe to hold a secure conversation. Recommendation?: For the love of God download this app, delete messenger and any other sms wanna be replacement platform. Want to be safe and secure I recommend this app. It beats any alternative platform of encryption based software out there. Please check their site out! There’s so much amazing little gold nuggets."
"Ok why??? I love telegram’s interface, the app is smooth. However, what I am going to voice out about is their “Find People Nearby” and “Nearby Groups” feature. There really is no need for that when this app was about private messaging. “. Fast. Secure. Powerful” and yet they add those two features that that contradict. What do I find on these features that’s displeasing? A bunch of random nasty people with nasty profile pictures. Moving on to Nearby Groups, like “m4m”, “m4w”, “taboo”..what is this, a throwback of Craigslist lol. Not enough moderation from Telegram on these features. Finally and most importantly, what happens when a child/ underage teen creates a Telegram account??? What then when they’re exposed to these things. Not good, just remove both things and your app is solid."
"Chats with GIFs seem to be the biggest cause, but after 5 min of using and viewing gifs the performance of gifs becomes a slide show. What is worse it even slows down all other apps on the device. Just 15-30min in a system reboot is needed. (Force closing the app doesn’t fix it) — This is probably also an iPad OS bug (I’m on latest OS v14.6) but this issue has happened to two iPads of mine, iPad Pro 10.5” (I think it was 2017) and still occurs with a brand new iPad Pro 12” 2021 model!

This issue has happened for almost a year now and there has not been a fix. Im very disappointed at this point. I have no idea why this only occurs on iPad devices, iOS devices dont have this issue. My iPhone 8 runs telegram so much better and that phone is so much older. :("
"Telegram is a perfect, secure, high speed cloud based messenger which it makes it almost the most powerful messenger app. 
But the problem is “file” sharing on iPhone. When you want to share a heavy file (by tapping the share button on the file and choose telegram to send) you have to look at the upload progress till it finishes the  percentage line! If you skip this level or want to do something else on your phone you won’t be able, or you will lose your file sharing progress. Whatsapp isn't like that and the file can be seen in your whatsapp messenger even if it has not been sent with a “retry sending” button that can easily send your file in the app itself and without exiting the messenger. 
Thanks"
"i dont usually leave reviews for apps but.... telegram is by far the BEST messaging app EVER! there’s no limit on file size to be sent, you can start polls, create your own sticker pack easily and you dont need your phone around to access your chats after the first time you log in (this is really my favorite part- especially when i forget my entire phone at home, as long as i still have my laptop with telegram pre-logged in ill be able to function. ALSO, SECRET CHATS! and theres so many special customizable features for telegram that you wonder why anyone uses any other messaging app in the first place!"
"After many of my favorite political social media personalities were deleted from Twitter and Facebook I decided to try out telegram. A few years ago I would say this app was fairly dead,However in 2021 there is so much content it’s insane. Telegram is my number 1 news app. It’s nice having all of your liked pages in a streamlined top down order . I also like how you can individually turn off notifications for all or individual pages you like. The private messaging is cool as well . Unlike Facebook and Twitter telegram is supposed to not sell your data to third parties. I’d highly recommend telegram at the moment 👏"
"I abandoned WhatsApp a long ago because it refused to offer the native iPad version, which forced me to use iPhone a lot of time. Its desktop version for macOS is a huge joke: I had to aim my iPhone at the monitor to scan QR-code in order to unlock the access every time I launch WhatsApp after booting up. Not to mention lot of security issues that kept coming up a lot of times.

I tested Telegram for a while and was convinced it is better app than WhatsApp. I persuaded my friends to try Telegram app, and many of them switched to Telegram while reducing the use of WhatsApp.

What makes Telegram shine? It has native apps for all of products running macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS with consistent interface. I like the animated stickers much more than emojis. So do my friends, too.

Other thing is that Telegram is independent (so far) and not under control of Fakebook or other corporations with vested interests.

The only downside is watchOS app that seems to take a while to load up the chats when launching. That‘s a very minor thing, not the end of world thing."
"I just came back from using Telegram after the latest update, video updates were something I was waiting for to happen and was really happy to hear that it became a reality! Although the video profile itself cannot animate unless I enter a person’s profile. I wish that, in the next batch of fixes, we can watch those video profiles animate while chatting, it would add a lot of liveliness to the chat!
Another thing I’m hoping for to drop in the next major update is calling (video/audio), and the ability to make group calls with my friends and colleagues. It would be a very useful and another exciting edition to an already amazing app.
Keep on doing the good work Team Telegram!"
"I love the custom ability of this app. The stickers are very well animated and vibrant too. I love the idea of having a safe app to chat to my friends with, although the only issue I can say is that I miss having the react feature that Messenger provides. Sure, I can send memes and stuff but I don’t really want to have to reply to every meme I receive when I can just click a button instead. 
I am 100% considering deleting Facebook messenger if you guys choose to hopefully update Telegram to have similar features, because I really love it. Just needs a few touches in my opinion and it will be perfect! You guys are doing a great job."
"Yo I love this messenger app but there’s a bug (or IDK maybe it’s feature-related but it drives me crazy) where if you use the app in slide-over mode on iPadOS, the Message Compose box is half-way obscured by the keyboard suggestion bar. This happens both with soft-keyboards and hardware keyboards. In full-screen (iPad, iPhone) and in side-by-side mode (iPad), it’s fine.
Other than the keyboard bar issue, this issue gets 5/5 from me. The groups work so much better than in other apps, you can reply to messages with rich previews and link back to the original message for context. The rich inline previews work amazingly, the sticker ecosystem is one of the best I’ve seen, and the calling and encrypted messaging features are a cherry on top!"
"I use telegram with my friends for our group chat over iMessage. there are a few critical features that make it much more of a user-friendly platform for heavy discussion groups. i love the “reply” feature. additionally, the search feature is unmatched; as long as you can remember even one of the unique words in a thought, you can locate the message. also the way the app sorts shared media into groups is extremely helpful. 

i heavily use the saved messages feature (the messages you share with yourself). 

last but not least, the fact that this platform is accessible on so many mediums, makes it easy to share thoughts and ideas across devices."
"I have been using telegram for almost 2 years, but there is an issue when I join new channels they don’t show up in the menu of chats, or in the folders menu, I only have to search them by name which is not really practical because when I forget the name the channel will be lost to me and I can never access to it and see the content.
Also there is another problem which is the limit of channels and groups that each person can join, I see that this feature is useless, you can’t control the number or choices of channels that people can join, and people cannot delete their older channels just to join new ones, I hope you delete this feature and make the number unlimited or at least increase it.
 I hope you will fix that problem, thank you."
"I really like the telegram app. Unfortunately I use a bunch of different group chats. The app refreshes so fast that I cannot  click on the message fast enough. I have to hit edit and then I can maybe scroll down to see it - often not.  

I think that when you click on the message icon it should automatically put those messages at the very top and hold them there until they are viewed. Until this is done I cannot give it more stars because it is very aggravating to try to see who messaged me. Sometimes I have to go on the web version on my ipad but there I cannot see the line that has the message icon. It doesn’t scroll down far enough. So then I have to go on the computer to the web version there. There everything works much better.

Please make these improvements!! Thanks."
"Apple needs to stop censoring channels on this app. Bizarre degenerates such as Tim “Rim” Cook have no right as to what apps I should be allowed to download or how I use them on the phone that I have bought and paid for. Such a thing is patently ridiculous and anti-consumer. 
Anyone who says something as low-IQ as “muh private company” is simply a boot licker, sycophant, and mentally stunted individual of indeterminate gender identity who should consider self-dispatching. 
Apple, do what’s right for your customers and immediately discontinue and reverse the practice of censoring Telegram channels because they don’t conform to the idiotic politics of the 400 pound flaming hair creatures that staff your HR department."
"I love telegram and have used it for years, but one problem that was been very annoying for the last 6-12 months since I have really started to use it on the iPad is that while typing in Telegram on a Bluetooth keyboard or Apple keyboard, the typing is very laggy and buggy. After a sentence or two is typed, it really starts to slow down and also makes more typing errors. It’s like it cant keep up. I was hoping an update would solve this, but many updates have gone through and nothing. I do not have this issue on any other app besides Telegram. It almost makes it not worth it to even type a message out on Telegram it is so bad. Please address Telegram! This should be a simple fix! Telegram is great besides this and fits all of what I want in a messaging app!"
"I’ve loved and used telegram for the past few years and have convinced my friends to all convert to the client. It does everything we need and I’d never consider switching. However!

I’ve recently gotten a 7th gen iPad with the keyboard case attachment, and for some reason, using the keyboard in Telegram is disastrous. Words will delete themselves and the text cursor will back up as if another force is trying to move it, meaning my messages are full of missing words and typed over mistakes. It’s frustrating, but not constant; it comes and goes. Unfortunately, it happens a little to much for my tastes. 

I’ll continue to use telegram, absolutely, just maybe less on this device in particular."
"This messaging app to me is a new and more better then Kik. Not trying to diss any app developers but telegram is at a level where simply anyone can understand. I was informed that this app has been around for sometime, and I’m just starting to hear about it. It has it’s highs and lows, let’s start with the lows when first accessing the app there’s a need of your phone number. Basic requirement, but I’ve started having problems with in an hour or so of using the app it starts popping up back to the beginning when I first entered my number. Not realizing that it has a limited amount of chances get back into app, was locked out for about 24 Hours. I hope this problem gets passed quickly and painlessly."
"I’m a big fan of Telegram , I use it everyday for nearly 9-12 hours,, and it’s really the greatest app ever 
but there’s something really bothering me which is each time someone join the app I get notification and a conversation came up! and I just can’t turn this off 😢
If we want to start a conversation with someone then we can just choose them , but it really bothers when conversations just started just because they joined the app ! and you’ll have to delete the empty conversation to keep your important ones up !
Please add settings to turn this off for those who want to 
Regards,"
"I recently was asked to download this for a job in order to be able to communicate with those at the job. Personally I prefer teams but this particular corporation prefers telegram.I have sent an email no less than about 4 times to ask for help with an issue I was having with the app. In fact some help unlocking my account since my account got locked because I had tried one too many times to login. I have received no help therefore I can’t work because I can’t talk to the people that I work with via the app. 
They should have more than one way to login or to recover your account if needed.I find it very disappointing to have no response to at least one of my emails. Even if they were to have a phone number you can call and get some help would be great but they don’t have that or that I found."
"I’ve been using this app for years now! It’s terrific, easy to learn and its so fun searching for the perfect sticker pack or you can make one of your very own! 

But if you want to chat with your friends using a wireless keyboard there’s a delay when typing, sometimes it misses what you wanted to write entirely. A good example of this small issue while using the app; lets just say you want to write the word, ‘Because’ and if you know how to type you’re in trouble. The app would miss words in between you’ll end up with something like “becue” and it happens a lot. This never happened before but its starting to become a problem now because sometimes I’ll end up with nothing!"
"Telegram is literally the only app I use everyday and every hour. It’s so great and useful. But I wanted to ask if you can reconsider on the option that a person can delete the chat for both sides.. everyone has important chats and the other person may be deleting the chat to delete evidence or just to annoy the other person so please just change this back to the way it was, it’s a nightmare thinking the chats you like to read over and over be deleted just because you have a fight with someone or any other stupid reason"
"Yep.  Didn’t take long to ruin an otherwise good idea.  Telegram has been “influenced” to censor the infamous attorney Lin Wood, for making “illegal” comments. Illegal? Lin Wood? Seriously? I know he’s not Jesus and is prone to error, but, my God! You actually have the balls - and stupidity - to accuse a lawyer who specializes in defamation of not knowing where the line is drawn on this particular subject.  You better change your tune quickly or be prepared to face actual litigation in the near future.  I use your service instead of Twitter or Facebook precisely to avoid dealing with stupid crap like this.  Signal here I come.

Update: I’m adding a star ⭐️ (2 —> 3) since you decided to let Mr. Wood out of jail.  But now you’re on probation.  Behave yourself and I might remember to add another one."
"Hello telegram people and thank you soooo much for this great app and thanks again for letting us use everything free and secure no matter what.
I am using this app for years now and i am gonna use it, even thogh my governement is so uncomfortable with it😄
And in order to use this app better i think adding two options would be great:
1. Abbilty to orgnize channels and groups and even chats in the SUBJECT order (for example: work, school, college, entertainment and ...)
2. Feed for channels ( i dont know if i am spelling right🙄) I mean somthing like instagram, to put all the channels you want on the feed and all of them appear on one place (and i know that is a huge request)
Aftre all i wanted you to know that we as iranins ( more than 40milion users and sellers and costumers) are waiting for your BLOCKCHAIN  update to fight and stand for our freedom for usinge which app we want, not the one THEY dicide for us!
Thank you telegram for every thing
(Sorry for grammer and spelling mistakes,😄 this is not my mother language)
Sincerely,a SUFFERD irannian person"
"Im only making this 5 stars because for the most part telegram has been my favorite messenger app for over a year now. Today I encountered a bug that won't let me send or receive calls or messages. All messages I attempted to send out have the red ""!"" next to them, and at the top of the screen it has a loading sign with the word ""updating"". The app basically hung. I deleted the app and re downloaded it but when I plugged in my number it says I don't have wifi. I obviously have wifi because I am posting this right now. I hope there will be some way that I can retrieve my account, together with all my messages and photos."
"Telegram has always been my favorite and most used app! I loved how easy to use and doesn’t have that annoying notifications & unnecessary messages.. in addition to the fact that you can open it anywhere from any device you have has been. Great help especially for students & business men who benefit from this option a lot
BUT!! I noticed the options has changed for the worse.. the last few months I noticed that I can’t leave groups I no longer want to be in!!! I can’t delete members (even if I was the admin :/) and there is groups that none of the members are admins!!! So what happened exactly?"
"From Telegra creators

Unfortunately, some Telegram features, such as stickers, don’t work correctly under iOS 11.4 that was just released – even though we fixed this issue weeks ago. 

Apple has been preventing Telegram from updating its iOS apps globally ever since the Russian authorities ordered Apple to remove Telegram from the App Store. Russia banned Telegram on its territory in April because we refused to provide decryption keys for all our users’ communications to Russia’s security agencies. We believe we did the only possible thing, preserving the right of our users to privacy in a troubled country. 

Unfortunately, Apple didn’t side with us. While Russia makes up only 7% of Telegram’s userbase, Apple is restricting updates for all Telegram users around the world since mid-April. As a result, we’ve also been unable to fully comply with GDPR for our EU-users by the deadline of May 25, 2018. We are continuing our efforts to resolve the situation and will keep you updated.

Sorry for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience."
I love the new update as a business owner using telegram.  I hate the fact that people could easily share our content.   Now you have fixed this.  But i have one request that i think all telegram users will appreciate.  With the new update. It now restricts everyone from sharing content even the group owner. Which i dont agree with.    As the owner i should be able to share.   Please update the app to allow administrators of the group to have the option to still share content.     And restrict those who are NOT administrators.    Thanks telegram hope your dev team sees this
"I’ve been using telegram a long time ago, but this year I started using it more, I realize that whenever your capacity is overloaded you cannot delete the files & pictures you want, you must go to settings & wait & wait until you get board without having any option except reducing the size of the memory capacity, I have a lot of pictures that I would like to delete without deleting important files.
Hope the developer can do something about this issue & set an option that you can delete the file you want without deleting the important files that you need"
"Are used to love this app a lot used it a lot I have a bunch of channels on and there’s a lot of audio files and after iOS 15 update I could not use audio at all it’s just showing that it’s not loading and it’s not playable or anything but everybody who has iOS 14 everything works perfectly fine so this is bothering me a lot and I want you guys to fix it as soon as possible other than that the app is the best at what I have used once the audio files and everything will be fixed will be five star 

Update fixed the best messenger app ever"
"For all of you wondering why does telegram offers end-to-end encryption when only secret chat is enabled, its false there’s a default end-to-end encryption in every chat. 

The secret chat provides client-to-client encryption which means ur data is encrypted and is not stored in telegram servers in any way but in end-to-end ur data is stored with encryption which will enable you to access ur chat when u change ur device or log in again so that u don’t lose your data just like every other chat app.

In my opinion its the best social media app that respects its users privacy and a real game changer.🔥🔥"
"My husband and I have been using this app for quite a while since we used to use Line but have been having issues with notifications not coming through. We like telegram a lot, it’s very clean and simple and FAST! However I would like to add a suggestion regarding the stickers; I love how there was a huge selection of stickers on Line, I have sooooo many on that app right now but cannot use them anymore due to issues with the app itself, is there any way to have more of a bigger selection of stickers like Line? I know you can make your own but honestly I don’t think I have the time to sit there and work on a pack of stickers."
"Worth getting to replace any IM you have had in the past. Simple and easy to use, regular, group, and secret chats, free stickers and the option to add your own, an audio player, completely free, and easy and large file sharing. Worth getting. 

Although, after this recent update, .WAV file playback of previously downloaded audio is not working. As a music artist, I tend to send others and myself the music I have made in this format as its high quality and I can play it wherever I am even without a internet connection. The player that used to open on .WAV files I assume has been switched for the player that plays .MP3 files. It does not play the .WAV files I had downloaded."
"Hi, This is really one of the best social app i have ever used, there is one issue about notifications, i have a group and i convert it to super one, now i have 320 members, all the admins including me can’t receive any notification at all till i or them open the group then all the new messages will appears , this is actually not good for us as admins so this means i should open the chat to see if there is someone write something!! I tried to mute the group then unmute it, also try to reset all settings in iPhone, also I tried another telegram apps in App store, same issue still exist for all the admins. BTW some of the admins have their own groups and they told me we don’t have issues in other groups that we created it or we joined it."
"Dear Telegram team. I am writing this to first thank you for your great work. I have been using Telegram for a long time and had no problem with it whatsoever. That's until today. I wanted to add a new profile picture . When selecting the new picture as the screen is navigating to the crop page the app freezes and stops working. The problem might be in rendering the crop screen. I am using Iphone 12 pro max IOS 14.6. 
I have tried closing the app. 
I have tried restarting my phone. 
None of those worked."
"I am using this as my main messaging app for the past 3-4 years. It has never let me down. And every update just brings more and more useful features to this already almost perfect app. 
Everyone is talking about how the video calls are important and giving lower ratings because this feature is not yet implemented. I am very disappointed by this. Telegram’s main goal always was maintaining privacy. If they can’t make video calls 100% secure — they will not add this feature. But I’m sure they will crack this one soon enough!
Thanks for literally the best app out there :)"
"Telegram is so amazing but when you want to download something you cant go to another app..,The app immediately stops downloading when you go to another app .I mean it’s so annoying please fix it . And also I would like to leave an opinion as to making some sort of organizer or type of file manager just to identify everything you’ve downloaded from telegram or in the telegram folder and organize it as in according to file type or date , you don’t need to scroll through every channel to look for a content you downloaded ..it will a win win for all of us.. thanks"
"Two things that they need to fix first and I will change to five stars;
First, in group chat if I close my phone without exiting the chat then get back on later it puts me at the bottom of all the unread messages, I’ll have to scroll up until I get to my last read message, so I have to exit the chat each time and then when I get back on it puts me at the top of my unread messages.
Second, I don’t have the ability in group chat to see who has read my messages, so I always have to scroll up to see who’s been online and at what time so that I can guess that maybe they’ve read the message.

Telegram please fix these two things"
"In a nutshell you could do a variety of things in telegram: messaging ✅, audio calling ✅, video calling ✅⚠️, using bots ✨ to send automated updates to a group.  

If you want to use telegram to manually 🎮 or programmatically 💻 send updates in a group chat, you can. Take a look at telegram API 🎯. 

You can also open telegram on multiple devices: computer 💻🖥, smartphone 📱and in a browser 🌎. A direct contrast with WhatsApp: you can use WhatsApp web on your computer provided it is opened on your phone as well. Telegram imposes no such limitations👍👏. You can have telegram on as many devices as you please with the same account. ✨

Now areas of ⚠️IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENT⚠️:

I see a bug 🐞🪲🪳when using the video call feature between a computer and a smart phone. The video is typically rotated by 90 degrees. There should be a mechanism for the video to rotate (as the user pleases) on any side of the conversation: you may have an auto rotate feature, but being able to manually rotate it will be very useful."
Factional morning my friend who has been a big girl in my past life is the most important things I’ve seen for her to be with you and you have never seen a person like me in the world and I wanna life would be more than life I love and love the fact allowing my hair for him and very long for Just it to become options so we could have seen the way I do it and it looks really cool to see the difference between a two year deal with you and the girls and the kids and the boys and the other people’s lives in their World Wide Web think they want me and my young ones people who have different styles for them.
"Dear Telegram developer team, 
In the latest update in which you provided some cool features to group chats like “slow-mode”, it’s been a very interesting tool for group admins 

My only complaint is that the way slow-mode currently works in groups is that when activated it affects all members in the group chat unless that member is added to the exception list. 

it would be so much easier if there’s a way to literally keep the entire group chat exempted from the slow-mode an only have slow-mode affect certain individuals. 

it’s way to time consuming for admins to constantly have to make sure that all members are on that  exception list so they don’t get annoyed with the slow mode activity. 

in the next update can you please have a feature to -[ ADD ONLY ]- slow mode 
In which admins can add members to a slow mode parameters on certain individual who message WAY TO MUCH in groups. 

please respond back if you have a possible solution to this request / issue."
"it’s literaly not one of the best communicating apps but THE BEST communicating app 
I almost do my everything with it . calls, messaging ,sending docs and photos , downloading and listening to music ,even downloading movies or reading books from some amazing channels . some even do online bussines with telegram. 
and it’s so pittiful that my country’s government has banned this app and we have to use vpn ti connect or even it’s happened that we can’t use it for some days . if you could do sth to solve this problem of ours ,it could be lifesaving and a good slap in our politician’s faces😂
thank u thank u thank u for your amazing flawless app❤️"
"Dear developers,
I appreciate the last changes, but it seems that something has changed to sharing feature. In previous versions when I wanted to share from another app to Telegram it all worked flawlessly. Now for some reason after  command to share via Telegram it pop-ups another sharing screen, where I need to share it again. Oddly enough, it has different colour scheme: my main theme is dark and first sharing screen also comes in black, as it supposed to be. However second one pop-ups in white. Hope you will address this issue in the next update. Happy New Year!"
"Gifs can cause the iPad to crash. Begins with stuttering performance and dropping animation frames. Regardless of whether you’re using the magic keyboard or touch, it’ll eventually become unresponsive to the point where your iPad is frozen and you have to force-reboot it. If you do manage to get out of the app the issues persist until you remove the app from your recents list. Really hoping this can be addressed soon. Telegram is my go-to for messaging and this is simply debilitating at this point.

Update: still has significant performance issues and will randomly cause the iPad to restart. Really hoping these problems can be addressed."
"This is no doubt my favorite messenger app and I advocate for it among my friends.

One problem: since some update about a month or two ago, messages that failed to be sent due to no connection (that lasted for a significant amount of time: 30min, 60min), don’t get sent automatically in the background once the internet connection appears. 

I am angry because I am used to the behavior that if I once press Send on a message, I don’t have to think about it again and it is *guaranteed* be delivered. Without this behavior, I have to manually check each and every message I’ve sent (which I don’t do) and otherwise get into inconvenient situations when someone needed to get my message hours earlier.

I would like to hear a reply from the Telegram team as for the reason for removal of this feature or a confirmation that it is just a temporarily bug that you will solve. If this is a performance issue, please provide an option in the settings to persistently keep trying to send messages, as it used to work before."
"Why don’t voice recordings (made outside the telegram app but sent in chat) and GIFs show up in “shared media?” Maybe in a future version, would it be possible to see GIFs in the shared media section, excluding the ones that are stickers? 

I also have some wild ideas I can’t keep to myself! 

Feature suggestion: it would be awesome if I could jump to the point in the standard chat where a photo was sent. Like I could tap on the picture in shared media, and there would be an option to jump to the day/time it was sent. 
Another related feature- what if I could jump to a specific time? “Hmm, what were we talking about on Nov. 4, 2019?” And I could somehow jump to the start of that day. 
One more! - what if we could “bookmark” specific moments in the chat, so we could jump back to that point and reread messages? I suppose a bookmarks section would be needed for this.

Telegram is a great app. I really love the improved search! It shows every time a word was said, instead of just the most recent time. It’s great!"
"I really enjoy using Telegram! It’s high Speed, smoothe, secure, and so functional!
But I really wish it had delivered sign/status (it already has the “sent” & “read” sign, but in my experience being sure that the message is delivered to the contact is even more important than “read” . In business and private use, this is a crucial factor . Imagine when your contact is on a flight and you text them, you wanna know if the phone is turned on already... just saying .
I really look forward to seeing the “delivered” sign ..
Thanks , good luck"
"I love Telegram and use it daily which is why I feel like the layout on iPad and iPad Mini needs an update. It would be so much easier to read and scroll if the feed was in full screen instead of split between the list of chats. 
If it was updated to shift to full screen after selecting a chat, like on the phone versions, with a back button to go back to the list of chats it would make the reading and scrolling experience infinitely better and easier to read. 
Thank you guys for your hard work with app development, we appreciate you."
"Hands down, the best app for messaging conversations that I’ve used. It has all the best features of every other messenger app out there, with the addition of many of their own great features, but with the exception of not having “reactions”, like we’ve seen in some messengers in recent years.

The biggest pros to Telegram is the ability to send large files as well as files of virtually any kind. On top of that, they offer message editing, deleting, scheduled messages, text formatting, hashtags, and more.

Get it while you still can."
"I find that looking at other members sign notifications is annoying, we don’t want to see that anymore, we like viewing our content instead not the notifications when someone is added to every time, it’s too much. We like looking at our messages the most. Please find a way to get rid of that Please and thank you in advance. Great app by the way. 👍👍 thumbs up on that. It needs new features also, I hope you have plenty on your sleeves. Hehehe 🤭 That would be great. 😊"
"I love the app. The features are great but the time delivery is not as fast as you said. I’m still comparing your platform to whatsapp because I’m about to make a switch. Whenever I send a message to my friends and family, it takes a few minutes for it to be delivered. They are living overseas but still whatsapp is faster. Please can you think about a new update that can fix this problem? It would be perfect! And, by the way, you can also add the fonction where people can post status 🙏🏽. That would be fun!😊. Thank you for your hard work ✌🏽"
"I’m enjoying the app for about 5 years. It’s getting better and more user-friendly with every update. But I have some more suggestions
1: Let users hide saved messages from the messages bar.
2: If you archive some chats or groups, it becomes unarchived by the time somebody mentions you in the group or chat. This feature is not that match with the archiving ability (which is used much as a hiding feature not a archive feature)
3: I think it would be very helpful if you let people to post messages and send files (pics, videos, and etc.) with knowing that nobody could forward those (taking screenshots are inescapable.
4: Let people archive their chats in a file as they can access them later if anything happened to their telegram account. I mean that the telegram messenger app has the ability to read files and apply it for messages and to recover chats if we took a backup already.
By the way. Thanks for your time."
"A few days ago it was working perfectly fine, the next night I go to use it on my iPod, it crashes out multiple times. I've tried uninstalling and then reinstalling it. Did nothing (just did it a third time same result) I even did a restart on the device itself, a couple of times and nothing! None of the usual fixes work for this! It still works on my phone but I use it on my iPod when I use my phone to watch a movie or something so I don't have to constantly pause and 'tab' out. And this is usually when I am in my bed at night and not near my desktop which also has Telegram on it. But this is getting really annoying please fix it!!!!"
"Video sending is sometimes an issue if you close the app prior to fully sending. Clients will send and exit the app and videos won’t go through. 

Quizzes/Polls are a bit cumbersome to create using the quizbot, and easier to create manually. However when trying to move them to groups it would just be easier for an administrator to create them within the group. Channels do not permit votes, and I’ve had to create a group edited into a channel to permit votes.

Overall, the app works well and is secure. These are only minor issues and I’d still recommend using it!"
"As a Furry, I downloaded this app because everyone likes the sticker mechanic. I was having fun chatting with people I knew on it until I discovered groups. This opened up a whole new way of communicating with people who have common interests with me. I started connecting with these random people, building relationships, having laughs, using this 17+ app to spread 17+ content but low and behold the group that I became the admin of and was spreading 17+ content in was blocked. Nothing from Telegram saying why or if it could be fixed so I may continue enjoying their app. Nothing about what content specifically called for the blocking. Nothing. If you wish to use this for a fun time, turn back while you can cause even Twitter is better. They aren’t 17+ but they have thriving 17+ accounts. Why are they allowed to have that and not telegram?"
"Sometimes we have issues downloading media because of MTProto’s quality and we have to select another one, but in a loooooooooong way, we should exit from channel/group first, pick another proxy from main menu, and get back to that channel (if we can find the channel or the media again), and if these issues remain with downloading media, we have to do this process again and again! Please add a way to change the proxy directly within channels/groups/chats, without having to get back to main menu"
"Hi there
i need to be able to Categorize my channels and groups not just putting them in Archives , as i have groups or channels about school , fun , Business , news ,sports,etc . So why wouldn’t u just let us decide to manage our groups and channels by folders therefore we could have some sorted folders by the user desire??? ??? i could move certain channels or groups about news in news folder also on the other specific folder,thus when i open archives i could see folders so i wouldnt say what a mess every fffff time i open Archives in telegram !!!!"
"I looooove Telegram. 
I’ve been using it for at least 5years now, and I have never had a complaint. It honestly keeps getting better and better.
Simple, Low data usage, fast, and all the features it provides, so detailed and necessary. 
Then the bots!!! Telegram allows users to develop their own bots. Which is so perfect because nobody really knows what you need more than a fellow user. Plus they’re perfect for groups and channels, when you need to collect data... 
 I know I sound super biased, but honestly these people deserve it. God bless y’all Telegram people. 👌🏾❤️"
"First off, telegram NEVER correctly downloads an entire chat from a group chat. It’ll say there haven’t been any messages since 6am when in reality there have been over a hundred. To fix this I am CONSTANTLY deleting and re-downloading telegram. This happened again and I had to delete and download again, and now it’s showing a glitch that it cannot log me in because I have no internet connection. I’ve tried restarting my device, tried on other devices, tried on data instead of WiFi, same glitch. Yet every single other application (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Email) is working just fine and I have perfect internet speed and connection. Fix this because it’s incredibly frustrating and I have to use this app as a part of my job, this is stopping me from doing so."
"Telegram has been a messaging service that is very light, quick, yet full of useful features such as mentioning — and most of all, completely free without disturbing adds and other privacy concerns. 
Yet even with the latest update, this app still has a number of glitches on the iOS 11. Some are crucial — like if you open the app as slide over on an iPad with hardware keyboard attached, the input field will be hidden beneath the keyboard shortcut UI, making it very hard to type correctly. 
Besides all the issues I’m having, this still is my favorite messaging service yet, and really hope to see it fully optimized for iOS — possibly with support for drag-and-drop and VoiceOver — as soon as possible."
"The telegram app is great for everything, except the stickers feature; which is intuitive up until the point the tell you that your sticker must be a 512x512 png FILE (not photo), and it gives you extra hoops to jump though.

My other grievance with the stickerbot of telegram is that it does not allow you to import your stickers from WhatsApp, which is where the majority of the stickers I use are. If the team can fix these issues, the app would be so much better, and dare I say it, convince even more people to ditch WhatsApp and switch to telegram."
"I love this app! I am so happy that I can use it across different platforms (like my iPhone and iPad, which is something I cant do with Whatsapp for example), but since I upgraded to the last version, everything is working...well, worse! It stutters, it lags, sometimes messages are not send, other times I cant download voice notes or videos even though I am connected to Wifi or mobile data, so, I guess it just needs some more polishing! Hope this can be fixed soon, and thanks to all the developers and people behind this app that are constantly working to improve it. You are doing an amazing job!"
"I love telegram and have been a loyal user since 2016. However, recently i have not been able to make any phone calls as it will always be connecting. The calls will never connect at all and hang up after 30 secs. i’ve tried switching to mobile data, all the different wifis i have and it still wouldn’t work. It has been a super huge problem and i have been using other platforms to make my calls, which have all been working well. I love using Telegram and still use it today for messaging, but i am very disappointed by the call function recently. Please do solve this, it is an issue that my friends have been facing as well."
"This is an easy application to use and I really appreciate end to end encryption. Dynamic dark mode is nice too. However, the latest update won’t send the messages I type when replying directly from a notification. More often than not, this is the way I interact with the app. For two days I have been replying to messages thinking that they have been sent, only learning that they have not been sent at all after opening the app. I asked my contacts if they had received the messages, that maybe they just weren’t showing up for me, and they had not. This loss of functionality makes using Telegram very frustrating. I hope this is an easy fix."
"No doubt the app is amazing, but it is of no use to me and millions like me who could not look into the app like most of the people do, we use an accessibility service called Voice Over screen reader  instead that would read aloud what’s there on screen. But unfortunately VO does not work that well on this app, I am not even able to go from  one message to another by swiping, this is a result of bad coding practice wrt accessibility.

If you are coming across this kind of request for the first time, suggest you to Google “Developing accessible apps on iOS” and learn about implementing  accessibility APIs offered on iOS, so that everyone could use it easily.

Still you need assistance  to make your app accessible, I would be happy to help."
"I love using this app everyday, it is my life, but I ran into a very annoying problem that I have used the support contact on the device for. My app has this annoying problem where when I leave the app open for a long while and don’t use it the background in all of my chats will turn pure white, I had no problem before the newest update. Please please fix this as I do not wish to keep re-adding the background over and over after not using my app for 30 minutes to an hour."
"I love this app, it’s my favoriting messaging app, though I’ve been a little disappointed in its behaviour recently.

It likes to reset itself and rid itself of all of my theme and language settings, so now my whole theme is gone for the third time and I can’t even set it back because the option to change the entire inner app’s colour is gone. (Which is really sad, that was one of my favourite features.) and my custom language has to be re-installed yet again.

Really inconvenient and disappointing that my app keeps changing without my say-so…"
"Because Telegram is the main communication channel for Nth Room - a group of 260,000 S.Korean child sexual abusers who blackmailed more than 80 little girls of ages 9+ to produce child porn and snuff films such as group raping, cutting their nipple off, putting living worms inside their bodies, etc. 

They are still producing, watching, and distributing the films under Telegram’s protection and the only way to throw every single one of those animals in jail as they deserve it is for Telegram to admit that “safe messaging” and “privacy” only apply to human beings, not monsters like these, and cooperate with the S. Korean police. 

Until Telegram makes that right decision to cooperate, I will only be able to relate Telegram with child sexual abuse. This is the reason why Im leaving Telegram. Please cooperate and help the abused girls, and the women fighting to protect them."
Telegram is definitely one the best messengers and I’ve been using it for like 6 or 7 years and never had any problems with it UNTIL now ! Previously I was using it on my iPhone SE and it was cool but recently I changed my Phone and now using it on my Iphone X and facing some issues . I can’t edit and delete messages for others like I could . I can only delete the messages for myself and I others would still see the them . And also the “edit” option would always come handy but I can’t find it anymore .
"Telegram messenger is the most used app in my country (iran)
Even the people who had no idea what is instant messaging are now struggling to find internet connection to be using telegram.
    The appearance is really nice and is highly flexible to your standards.
The speed is one of those things that is keeping me and others from using other applications.
I have never seen any problems regarding the privacy and for me it has been safe for around 3,4 years.
Best of all is the tendecy to grow;
Telegram is constantly being updated and lots of things have changed during the years.
      Only one problem i have come across is when i am playing music;
The app is always  automatically trying to download the previous song and if i ever forget to cancel the download, the damage is done and if this happens too often lots of data would be gone! Which is why i am getting this app 4stars but other than that, it is highly recommended by me."
"I don’t understand why there is an “option” to allow telegram to sync your Contacts from your phone when it still accesses your contacts anyways even when you say no. The point of that feature is usually a privacy feature, but if the app is still accessing your contacts I don’t see the point of that feature...This is honestly a breach of privacy.  It’s a great app and nice that it lets you know when people from your contacts join but it’s !!!anoying!!! that it’s not an option. I’m not sure if it’s a bug or if it’s supposed to be like that? But that is my review on the app. Also I shouldn’t have to go through a site to delete my account or wait a month, that should be an OBVIOUS option..."
"I really love this app because i’ve joined to so many learning channels where i can find so much interesting books. 
But lastly, i cant download pdfs or books! 
I wanted to report this issue, then i faces to next one that telegram support is done with volunteers, so anyway I couldn’t report this problem! Then i tried to update my telegram so maybe it’ll fix the problem, but still NOTHING has changed! 
   So kindly fix this problem cause one of the main reasons why i use this app is finding and downloading my favorite books easily, and if i couldn’t do this sadly i’ll stop using this app!"
"Recent report that new iPhoneSE users unable to download Telegram app from Apple Store. I was unable to contact Telegram with this important intel. 
Easily correctable problems include 1. Date all posts 2. Allow Reply 3. Post NAME of Admin with group name, otherwise mysterious admins have no accountability for their sometimes ridiculous or slanderous statements. 4. Comment right below that post rather than all over the place! 
This confusion leads to people not knowing WHO or WHAT Reply poster is complaining about because Replies not connected even by date with original post."
"I use Telegram to keep in contact with lovely people I met through tumblr but who live overseas, so regular texting wouldn't work without racking up huge fees. Telegram makes conversations easy, and I love being able to see when my friends have been online last. And the ability to send gifs is wonderful! I do, however, have some suggestions: When a gif is received from someone else, it would be nice to be able to save that gif to my phone. Also, being able to customise notification sounds by importing them from my phone or Zedge or other ringtone apps like that."
"Pictures got Black after cropping! I dont understand what happens to pictures when you crop them but you will have a black image after that.

For God’s sake pleeeeeeeeeease add an ENTER bottom to editing caption. For all those using iphone to post a picture we should first write the caption in other chats box then cut it, then open the picture and paste the text  in the caption box due to the problem you don’t have ENTER and we couldn't write a caption in 2 separated lines. 
It seems you (the telegram developers) never use iphone to post clips and pictures with caption🤨."
"Telegram is a wonderful app, leagues ahead of major competitors, based on it customizablity and flexibility it is really good for the most part. However a major issue I have is how one member of a conversation can opt to clear the chat for both participants. If anything it should be one sided and not affect both parties. The ability to unilaterally delete a chat completely makes things very unfair and uncertain. I suggest that feature be patched out especially since a lot of business is conducted on the app. There’s the obvious consequence of fraud and scamming making it super easy to clear their tracks. I’d ask that the developers work and fix this issue."
The person in charge of this update should be fired because he took the most best social app and turned it to complete rubbish in the previous versions the most weakest connection would be enough to connect but now a strong connection and still wont connect and the ui has become very stupid looking and the calls have become so irritating  it keeps saying contacting half the time and the handsfree feature when calling doesn't work anymore Really mad for messing with my favorite app
"Have been using this app for three years already. All the things that I wanted to be added in Telegram are now there and even better than I could imagine. At this point, I use Telegram for every possible thing, since it has sooo many features. However, I would like to ask you to add the possibility to create to create check-lists or something like that, so that people don’t need to use another app to manage their tasks for the day. 
Thank you very much for this amazing app:)"
"hi Telegram team! i have a suggestion to make your app way more neat.
as an antisocial person, all i have in this app is channels and i would love to have them organized and not go through 20 tabs to find the channel i want. i would love to group the channels together by category so finding them would be easier.
also, who was behind removing the option of being able to search in songs when you're offline??? because you should fire them
all in all this app is amazing, just needs a few small touches!"
"The only thing that matters to everyone is privacy sometimes people try to use your messages or try to betraying you with their own messages or even forwarding your private messages but you work hard to stop these things . With the new update I can confidently send message without any worry about the consequences. 
The best messaging app I’ve ever have in my life! 
But only one thing! Calling quality needs to be better than this without interrupting the call."
"I just downloaded this for the first time a few days ago, and I'm already addicted! I love the group chats, and the app is easy to use. One thing I do find frustrating is that if you click out of a group chat and then return, it jumps to the most recent message, which can be a problem in larger groups (I'm in one with 170+ members). It would be nice if it would save your last position in the chat and then give you the option to scroll to the most recent messages. Other than that, I have no complaints! It's 10 times better than Discord and Facebook."
"I can't trust this app. Sometimes it makes the notification sound like I'm getting a message and then when I open it there are no new messages.
So what's up? Why is it making that sound? And I know for sure it's Telegram making that sound not any other app 'cause I've changed the notifications sound a few times to be sure I'm not confusing it with another app.  And it's always the Telegram sound and too often no new message? So I constantly feel someone is sending me a message but it's not showing up :(

I have group message notifications off so this looks like a problem with personal messages. 
Or I don't know because I don't know what's going on and it's EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING 😡"
"Half the time I can’t hear who I’m video chatting with (and it’s not user error - I know how to adjust volume and mute/un-mute). I can resolve the problem usually by hanging up then calling back.
Other times when I receive a video chat, if the video is on, there’s no option to turn on speaker - so during the call, I have to decide whether to hold the phone up to my ear to hear them (and they get to look at the inside of my ear) or I get to see them and try to read their lips…
The only reason I keep this app is because I have contacts who refuse to use any other… (but I don’t know why they chose to be loyal to this lower tier communication app.)"
"‏Hello, I have been used the Telegram application for a long time and I would like to find all the features inside it because it is a special application for me, but from my point of view, the application needs only one feature, which is the story feature that is inside all applications. So please, I want you to fix the defect in the communication feature, because the sound has become weak and the background sound for the user, which I cannot hear, and the sound is also defective. Please look into the matter"
"Telegram is an incredibly strong and secure social network application, and i’ve been using it pretty much since the day it came out. The only problem i see in it is that it doesn’t have a video call option, rather making users only use voice calls, which makes the app different but weirdly “Specific”. 
The new update has this bug that it just crashes and gets out of the app whenever you’re listening to a music file, sending a Gif or Stickers. Please fix that. Thank you!!"
"This is the way my son and I communicate. He’s mentally disabled so I needed a way to keep an eye on him without needing a Facebook account. That’s not my thing. This really works for our family. 

I’ve heard that Apple is trying to get rid of this app for whatever political reason, I don’t care about politics. If that is the case I will be getting rid of all my apple products as they won’t work for me anymore. 
This is about my family, it’s not political for me."
"Man I loved when telegram fixed it problems with 3D Touch buts like they fix a thing and another one gets crazy, when I try to delete a photo it lags and shuts the app. I thought it was just my phone but I’ve tried it on other phones and it’s the same problem. That’s one of them, the other one is that you can’t actually see when somebody disconnected because in contacts it says one thing and in the chat says another one... and when you hear a voice message I don’t if it’s just me but it records another voice message without me doing nothing"
"This app is sheer good. Security, speed and flexibility is top notch. Only issue I have with this app is during messaging someone when I drag down to normal state it doesn’t come normally, that’s the only issue I have seen. Also Your policy of if away for 12 months/ 6 months is a little bit problematic. Like if someone is busy might not come at all or might use other services. Instead give a feature like: If someone attends one will get an option for authentication that proves he/she is actually back instead of deleting account in first place."
"I have been applying for jobs on Indeed and a scammer reached out to me asking me to download this app for the job briefing and interview. After doing so, red flags began to pop up; you know, the obvious red flags.. misspelled words, grammatical errors, not answering my questions. I think the end goal was for me to be “hired” and they have me fill out a W2 and bank deposit form for access to my SSN and bank details. 

I’m not saying this is the apps fault, I am saying it’s not as secure as they may think. Just be aware and on your toes if someone you don’t know asks you to download this app as it seems scammers are now using it."
The only way to use this for voice messaging is to have the phone angled straight up at the ceiling and make sure you don’t put anything within 6 inches of the front of the screen or you will have a black screen. And then your audio recording will pause your audio playback will pause and likely will not allow you to send the message it cut off because the black screen kicks in immediately there is no way to turn it off and nothing you can do rendering this mostly useless for a voice messaging unless you want to lock the voice message and set the phone down to use it
"I am loving this app so far however... i suggest that you add a story/status feature similar to snapchat, instagram and many other social media/messenger platforms. It is a post that can be broadcasted to multiple contacts at once and is very useful for sharing out messages towards a broader audience. Rather than having to forward many messages or send a-lot of messages to a bunch of individuals or make a group chat just to send a message."
"The telegram app is a nice app I love the features that telegram offers us, this app is perfect everything is correct, (calls, audio, images) everything works very well.
 But, I would like you to add a very small modification it is about (Story) this feature interests us so much because with it we can share cool stuff evryday with our friends,which also makes the app cooler.
But otherwise telegram is a very good app and does not consume a lot of Data. 

-I suggest you download it"
"I love this app, it keeps me in touch with people all over. I have only two requests, increase the number of channels/groups/people we can Pin to the top to 10 and it would be amazing.  It still gets 5 ⭐️ from me regardless, but that would be helpful to find the ones I check more frequently. 

The second, please find a work around to get the app directly from your website for IOS users. 

Thank you for this app!!"
"This is the most fraud infested place on the market. They take you money they sell stolen information and credit cards and all type of personal information. please you guys stay away especially if you don’t know the group or was not invited because this place is like H E L L. And support do not care the are apart of this, they have to be, you can report these crimes and support will ignore you, because these fraud groups are big with lots of followers so it makes majority of their platform, so for them not to do something about this they are apart of it. It’s one thing to have privacy but don’t help the criminals make money in privacy I can’t wait till the FBI end this it makes no sense"
"Hello and don't be tired Recently, the original version of Telegram has been having problems with iOS, even with your new eternity, the problem has not been solved. It takes a long time to connect to the proxies and it is too late to download the movie or photo. This problem is related to the application itself. When I use Telegram X, although its version is old, but it downloads at a very high speed, thank you for fixing this problem."
"After trying several messaging apps Telegram is the most functional. Particularly with integrating with Apple Watch among other features and customizations.  What keeps me from using it however is the sticker integrations.  While I don't mind the stickers, I don't use them and when selecting emojis, don't want the suggestions.  If there was an option to turn this feature off I would be more inclined to adopt Telegram as a serious messaging platform.  Right now the sticker integrations feels forced and distacts from an otherwise excellent messaging app."
"Love the app! I love all the features that iMessage and other messaging apps don’t have such as animated emojis and mini video messages. However, I’m in a group with about 1,000 people and the notifications go by very quickly so by the time I get back it’s very difficult to know how far up to scroll to see the messages I’ve missed. It would be awesome if there was a feature that just scrolled you back to the top of the last message you missed. That is the only thing I’d improve :)"
Unfortunately sometimes Telegram starts flashing two different lists of conversations and in this state it does not let you user it as it constantly jumps between conversations and makes it impossible to use it. The only solution I found for getting out of this is to uninstall and reinstall it. Even after doing so again I faced the same issue and I am thinking of uninstalling and reinstalling again 🤔😞 it's so disturbing 😩😩 please fix it as soon as possible.😣😣
"I was reached via text message and was told to download this app… once downloaded I was conducted in a fake interview and was sent a bad check that was suppose to be for “equipment material”. After trying to cash the check … thinking I had a “job”.. the check turned out to be fake. I felt so stupid being the scammer had me sign over most of my personal information! 

Please be on the lookout because scammers are using this app!!! They will text your phone acting like they found your resume and will tell you your interview will be held through chat on this app. 

I tried reporting the chat but that didn’t really help.. they only gave me the option to block the individual. Thankfully I screenshotted everything before the scammer was able to block me after I notified him the check was fake. I put my trust into this man because everything seemed so real! Once I called him through this app his English was very broken and he sounded like he was Indian or Nigerian or something.

Please be on the lookout and only chat with people you know."
"On the very first screen of setting the app up (adding your phone number) there’s a bug and because I can’t get the information properly input, I can’t go to the next step making the app useless. (I have an iphone11 If that makes a difference) 

When I go to enter the phone number, it’ll allow me to type in the prefix spot and/or select a country to automatically fill this box. Then I click the actual phone number spot to add the other 10 digits and you can see the cursor there but as soon as you start typing, whatever you’re typing goes into the prefix box and no matter what I do I can’t get anything typed into the other box."
"I love telegram, and use it for keeping up with friends in a more convenient manner than texts.

But it has an annoying habit of embedding itself into IOS. I have denied it every permission I can and every setting in the app itself.

But if I go to my iOS contacts, and tap on a name, tap on the voice call icon the first item on the pop up menu is telegram, not my phone. Why?! It’s denied access to my contacts... it shouldn’t be in the call list for them."
"I like the Telegram app.  It is a good application .But I think the weak point of Telegram is that the same number of Telegram accounts can be run on another device.  So that the privacy of the chat does not remain.  Anyone can abuse it.  You should solve about it.  Like any other application any application must be activated in that new instrument and automatically deactivated in the old instrument.  Otherwise you are smart all the people who created this app
Thank you"
The old Telegram had the most amazing feature. Which helped a lot in off the record conversation. Now you need to go and make a completely new “secret chat for it” it was so convenient to continue talking in the same window then click a timer on that moment of the conversation where the chats disappear. Please bring back timer options in regular chats and sharing pictures.
"Since the most recent update some of the animated stickers don’t work. Only see the comment box with a blurred image of the sticker telling me it’s an animated sticker🙄Also the sound notification doesn’t always work. But that’s been the case since 2 updates back😒—updated: not quite there yet. Some still don’t work.—Update #2: Every time I use this app my phone warms up. I was told that this was indicative of bad programming. It started doing this recently. I was also told a messaging app shouldn’t use a lot of processing power in comparison to a photo app, etc. Please fix this😤"
"Hello, I’ve been using telegram for about 5-6 years and enjoyed it a lot as it’s fast and much more better in comparison with other apps. But there are some problems I have  with the latest version which are annoying. 
1)I can’t delete my latest profile photo until I add a new one.
2)The music playing in the app is not reachable while you are in shared media.
3)Sometimes when the music is playing in background, suddenly it stops and I have to reopen telegram and play the music again.
Thank you in advance for your help🙏🏻"
"this app is crazy cool!! i use it all the time. i don’t have any complaints. every feature stated in the description is accurate, efficient, and always smooth. i’m wondering if there would be a way to lock normal chats with a passcode? say you have a chat that is preexisting and you want it to be secure but not for that information to be deleted after a certain amount of time. why not be able to set a passcode for it? it would be very useful. thanks for all the great work put into this messenger!!! i hope this review gets read :D"
i kept encountering a problem where one second i could send files over 100mb then another second it stops sending after 30mb. the only solution i have is to close and restart the app after a while and then it would start sending again. i have a lot of videos i need to send but this problem is making it very hard for me to upload a file over 30mb without needing to restart it every time. please fix it!
This app is one of the best apps I have ever used! There is one thing that I hope you will add to this app and that is (downloaded media) I am in a group that has more than 8k media and I downloaded some of them on the app but then when I tried to reopen them I had to scroll all the way down and often found my self lost before finding what I was looking for. So I think you guys should add this feature to make searching for what I downloaded way easier!
"Hello Telegram Team,

I would like to feed back and report for the issue.

I have problem when I live stream.
When I live stream has participant below 20 the sound and video share screen is goods. But
1- When a live stream has above 20 participants the participants can hear the sound but cannot see the video share screen. 
2- When a live steam has above 20 participants you can see video share and good sound but if you leave and join live steam again you can hear only sound, and video will be blank.

If live stream have only a few participants it will see the video and sound.

If you can fix for get many participants it will be good for the user.

Or we have to purchase the plan?

Please kindly help to respond to this problem or Should I purchase the plan?"
"With the new updates, Telegram is probably the most detailed, most up to date and the best messenger ever!
But there is a little, but annoying bug.
When you want to take a look at a song thumbnail in the app ( on iPads only), you have to turn the iPad to portrait to be able to view it in full size. It doesn’t enlarge it while in landscape orientation. Please fix this issue. It’s really annoying specially while using the iPad with the Smart Keyboard.
Thanks for your great app and service."
This app is great for chatting with friends. It’s got a good format and organization. It would get a 5 if it weren’t for the fact that the app stops working when it’s not open. Sometimes the notifications icon doesn’t appear when there are messages waiting to be read. The app will close itself occasionally. Switching between apps will sometimes throw me back to the message board. The unread banner will show up in chats even though I haven’t left that conversation. Most are minor issues but missing notification and that app closing itself are really aggravating.
"I have the latest version is the app installed, but for some group I can only access limit amount of media, maybe just twenty days? Photos or videos before that will be white blanks. 
This is bad, I love this app but this issue kept me from enjoying it, and my iPhone storage still have much to play. Please help fixing this issue or at least give me some feedback to resolve it."
"I’ve been using this app for 7 years now and it never disappoints me and it gets even better with the cool updates and new feature but there’s just this bug that I discovered recently and it’s been annoying me ever since, the saved gifs can’t be deleted. There’s the delete option that i use it and the gif disappears but the next time open telegram and i see that it’s back again. I would really appreciate it if u fix that as soon as possible:)"
"this application is by far the best messenger for smartphones and pc the pc app is as good if not the same quality of the mobile version which is rare, the app doesn’t have adds or privacy concerns and always get updates with new useful features, I used it extensively for study and doing my work saving my stuff communicating with my friends and family and much more, really deserves 5 starts and I recommend it to everyone."
"Hello dear Telegram support team.
 Your app is wonderful in almost every aspect that a messenger app should have. 
There’s only one thing you might want to add to Telegram and it’s a timer for music and such so that a song can stop playing after a specific amount of time. This way the app can be used to play some songs or a few audiobooks for kids and be turned off at the given time.
Thank you for your consideration."
"The texting on this app is great but when it comes to calling it’s not so great and could use some work. The calls either don’t go through, sends me a notification of an incoming call but shows the actual call coming through a whole minute later, or the call doesn’t come through at all but I still get a notification and it makes my screen freeze for a few seconds. I have an iPhone btw. I used this app for two days but uninstalled it and went back to WhatsApp because of the calling feature."
"IT's WORKING AGAIN 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻Thanks a million 🌹❤️🌹❤️🌹❤️🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Your App is absolutely wonderful and speechless period!!!

After the last update seems there a bug in the music playback feature. Till now when playing a new or last downloaded music track, it was automatically playing all the tracks one after another in same page or group or channel which was working as an amazing music player (thanks for that also) but I guess after the last update a nasty bug is disturbing it!!! Now its only working in a loop mode and repeatedly plays the same track unless you stop it manually or tapping the next track to be played!

Please please help ! I don't know others but for me it's catastrophe 🥴🥴🥴 and at the same time not good at all for App's reputation 😜😈😜😂😈😂🥰😉👍🏻
Please!"
Be careful downloading this app as there is people on this app trying to scam others. There’s a “company” that will tell you to download this app for they can interview you but it is all a scam. They will offer to send you a check for you can buy “office supplies” for your at home office but then they will have you try to make a payment into a private vendor. Thankfully I was not dumb enough to fall for their little trap and caught them before they were able to send the “check”. Once you catch them in their scam they will delete the conversation on their end and it will also delete on your end for there won’t be any way to trace back to the conversation.
"When we listen to music with Telegram media player ( music in Telegram chats ) and wanting to listen to a voice message, it will stop the music and we must find the music again and play it after listening to voice message! It’s annoying, you can separate the media player of music and voice message and when we play a voice message, the music pauses and after the voice message, the music resumes.

Please look for a solution ASAP.
Sincerely"
I’ve noticed lately that my Apple Watch Series 4 (which is running the latest WatchOS) is unable to properly display my chats.  It simply tells me that I have “No Conversations” I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app as well as restarts to both devices and running the app on my watch while I have Telegram open on my iPhone.  None of these things seems to do the trick.  I love using the WatchOS app to quickly send a sticker or view a chat history without needing to dig around for my phone.  It won’t work at all for me.  Please fix!!
I enjoy chatting with large groups within this app but when multiple people are sharing info/media it can get hard to find the info you are looking for easily. Can you add sort/filter or labeling options for the media and file tabs? It would be nice to be able to create more than one media tab and be able to label those various tab options within a group. Fix that and you get 5 stars easily!
I use this for my coaching business to communicate with my clients but every time I get a message the notification stays up even after I’ve checked it. My clients have noticed the same thing. I would greatly appreciate this glitch being fixed so it looks more professional and so I don’t have to fully turn off notifications. All in all love everything else especially the video feature. 👏🏽
"Hi there, I have a suggestion to improve lovely telegram: adding 5 pinned group was a very wise option; however, it is not enough. Please add grouping to telegram. For example, I like to have 4 different tab for groups of channel in mine: first news, second friends and fun, third movies and series, and finally  dental groups( my business). It is not perfect when You are surfing your business groups suddenly a friend group distract you from what you looking for. Thanks for your great support."
"The last update for telegram is really cool, but there's only one problem about the storage, so when I download any video or audio or photo or anything the media take space from my iPhone and every time when I download something new i go to setting to check from the size of the app I see the the telegram app using more storage from the last time when I check it, so hopefully to fix this problem as soon as possible ."
"The privacy options for the profile pictures are so limited.. please allow us to make some or one of them public, not all of them or nothing.. I want the people who text me to see a picture not my name letter to know that I am real and trusted person not a spam or fake account, but at the same time I don’t want them to see all my pictures history.. one is enough! So please try to make this possible.. thank you 🤍"
"Hi, really enjoying your app. The videos are not loading  ever since l updated to the latest update. Looks like there is a glitch. Asked some friends, they are not able to view the videos either, keeps showing the videos as blared and when clicking on the videos it is trying to load but stops in the middle. I have lots of memory on my phone and tried to clear some chats but still the same. Please fix. Thanks"
"The latest update has a very annoying notification bug and a huge privacy/security issue. Badges are not clearing after messages are read which is frustrating but I can honestly deal with that. My biggest complaint about this update though is the fact that banners and alerts now show profile pictures with no way to disable them even if the “Names on Lock Screen” setting is turned off. If I have that setting off, the app should not be showing any sort of identifiable information on notifications. I don’t know how no one at Telegram took this into consideration but it needs to be fixed ASAP!"
"I’ve been looking for a way to share information to a large number of people all at once, and it is so easy with this app, I wish I discovered it sooner. Plus, it feels good to not have to worry about how my data may be used or be stolen, and the freedom this app gives me to customize and create is unlike any other application I’ve used. Excellent!!"
"I’ve been using this app for years and i like it , but something has kinda been on my nerves lately..
I really wanna clear some caches but since they were posted on a channel i can’t do it by deleting it . And i don’t want to clear some vids/files from the same channel so i can’t use clear cache on settings. 
I wish there was a way to clear those caches ( like , something like the delete button for pics and vids but to clear their cache , which would be really helpful)
I hope u take that into account"
Please go back to the old version where you can report a group for certain things not just report in general than leave instantly if I report I may want to stay in group but Telegram wants you to leave. I'm asking Apple if that is in the App Store rules if not Telegram maybe kicked out of the store. Be aware of companies making bad decisions in coding apps hiring those who don't understand coding and UI and user interface. I am learning coding so I can see how poorly most apps are designed. Highly recommend looking for other apps not Telegram till they fix the mistakes. Everyone give 1 star review maybe Apple will notice it and Remove the app that way.
"I had have many messaging apps like WhatsApp, line, and viber. But Telegram was the most convenient of them. Apart from its various and useful features, it’s fast and easy to use.

It’s worth mentioning that Telegram unlike its fellows, WhatsApp in particular, doesn’t sell our data to corporations and governments. So I’m sure that my privacy is respected there.

Putting aside the video call, I really don’t get why people use WhatsApp. It’s not as secure and user-friendly as Telegram."
Voice calls in telegram have been so bad of not the worst for like eternity.. i mean i am in love with the app and I don’t want to use another app for just voice calls please try to fix these issues :- 1) the voice is so unclear it feels like talking underwater and btw both mics of the callers are perfect ..2)it keeps reconnecting from time to time and the Internet works just fine on other apps with the same callers..3)it keeps breaking like H-E-L-L-O .. thanks for the graphical updates tho ..so much love <3
"One of the best apps Messaging apps I’ve ever used. Been using Telegram for a few years now and it beats all the others.

However, what on earth is going on? Ever since iOS 15 came out I have had the same issue on two different iPhones. If I hit the paper clip to share a photo or video, the app freezes and never correct itself. You have to close the app to then use it again. 
Only way to send a photo or video is the do it through the photos app."
"I am blind and use the VoiceOver screen reader on IOS.  I am able to use the app, but it is difficult because some of the buttons are unlabeled.  An example is the button to do an audio chat.  It took me 10 minutes to figure out where it was because VoiceOver just says “button.”  I like the idea of this app, so I hope the buttons get labeled for VoiceOver users.  I would love to be able to share this app with all my FaceBook friends, but I shouldn’t do this until my friends who are VoiceOver users can easily use the app. I apologize if this is too harsh."
"Telegram is one of the most underrated messengers out there. It has excellent, innovative features and has ben working great ever since I joined the app. 
The recent update is causing some problems though. I searched online and found out multiple users have been having the same problem with this version. It either gets stuck on ""Connecting"" or on ""Updating""."
"Your latest update may have broken Carplay enabled use and that's a big no-no. It worked flawless before your update and I've seen no release by devs on this or if they're going to say it's an iOS update,which I doubt since my wife's iPhone is updated and not on the Beta program BUT mine is and BOTH are broke. Please fix this Csrolay issue devs, we'd apparently it!

Still 5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ application regardless...."
"I’ve loved Telegram since day 1, even if the following things don’t get changed/added, I will always use Telegram instead of Whatsapp 

Suggestions/Requests:

1. Let us pin more conversations: I have multiple family groups that I would love to have pinned to the top of my list or chats. 

2. Export conversations in an easy way: I have conversations with my mother who past away last year that I would love to export, including the photos. 

3. Allow us to put a picture or icon on users on our contact list who don’t have a picture on their profile. 

4. Replace the stickers with something else. A lot of us dislike the stickers and their integration to the app. Do what iMessage does it great. Integrate other apps or options: emojis, gifs etc. 

That’s all for now. Hope someone responds."
"Dear telegram my music cover doesn't show up, there is some bug with downloading video messages and the animation of downloading doesn't work correctly. Also I need to close and reopen the app so that I can download video messages, plus the notifications have some bug mostly for first one.
After Update 8.2.2: i can’t even send new Gif to people! What’s happening telegram?!
Ios 12.1.1 🧡"
"While this app seemed to be very efficient for messaging which is always great but at the same time leaves you opened to be targeted by scammers (which I was) because they know with this apps secure network can’t be traced back to them. 
Be aware that scammers are also post fake job post on major platforms like indeed, LinkedIn and Glassdoor. Which is is how I believe was the main source of contact at first then they ask you to download this app. While it’s great to want to keep people’s information private I also believe it makes it harder for the proper authorities to catch the ones scamming."
"If you’re a racist, Hitler loving Nazi, then this is the app for you. There are no rules. You can chat about killing millions of people and the extermination of numerous races and religious groups. You can share all your white pride posts. Post videos of violence against minorities. It’s got it all.

Seriously, this is the most vile social media platform I have seen since 4chan. Telegram does not care about the safety of minorities or basically anyone who is not white and Christian. The type of channels on this app, which can easily be found, deserve no place in our society and as far as I am concerned, Telegram is actively promoting hate and violence towards other communities. You should be ashamed of yourselves."
"Hi! On the bottom of the bar next to the text box, there's a button that you can switch between voice message or a mini video. Unfortunately, since the new update, each time I try to play it back, the screen will turn black and flicker from normal to black for a few seconds as the video plays. When I try to leave the app, the screen will turn black one last time since the video still plays for a few seconds when exiting the app. Thanks guys, keep up the awesome work!"
"This application is one of the best applications in the world with the best settings and the best personalization in the application.  Everyone in the world uses it and loves it.  I enjoy working with this app and I don't get bored. This app is very easy and easy for everyone to work with. efinitely  will be one of the best applications because of the way it is made, because the human grandson can use it. Old and young, literate or illiterate, etc. It's just a pity that they boycotted it in Iran."
"I never write reviews. But the sole purpose of Telegram for me was business development. I belong to groups within my industry that allows for making new connections. However, Telegram, for no apparent reason, has flagged me for spam and has limited my account to only allow sending messages to someone who is already in my contact list. Essentially making this app useless. I’ve never sent spam. They have a spam bot in which you can say “I’ve never sent spam”...but nobody answers. I’ve tried contacting their support team, but no one replies. One star until someone actually speaks with me from the company and explains exactly what happened and lifts this limitation from my account."
"This app is great. It would great if secret chats could be labeled. My friend and I use this app between our phones, Macs, and I use it on iPad. When I try to message my friend, I just sort have guess which chat might to go to his Mac and which goes to phone. He has to ask me to switch another secret chat that sends to his Mac. I’d like to be able to label that secret as ‘Mac Chat’ and the other ‘Phone Chat’ so I can tell them apart. Of course, he will have to tell me to switch, but a labeling ability would great."
"Thanks for all the features but there are multiple things i would love to see in this app including:

1. An eyedropper in the editing part is really needed.

2. There’s a “pin to top” feature which is amazing. but have you ever thought of a “pin to bottom” thing?
sometimes there are secret chats or groups we don’t want to see but we cannot delete or leave them at the same time. it would be great if we could pin the to the bottom of our chats.

3. For making video calls I have to use other applications which is annoying. telegram needs to have this feature.

4. If we could just star or label some texts or medias in chats, groups and even in the saved messages, we could save important things which is easily accessible too.

Thanks for your consideration!"
"First and foremost, I really like this app. I am just writing this review because I faced with this situation many times.
When I am searchin an specific word it could be really easier if I have this option to choose search on what group. For example search on my private chats, channels or groups. In this way I can find what I want so quick.

Thank you in advance for you consideration and your great app!"
"First off, the only reason I did not give this three stars is this: I really hate the fact that this app relies solely on your phone number, and that when I choose NOT to sync it with contacts, people FROM my contacts can still search me and find me somehow..? Do I have to block all my contact numbers? That’s ridiculous.

Other than that, the app is great. The stickers are beautiful, the ability to choose your background is great, the dark color scheme is fantastic… Telegram is honestly great."
"This app is very accessible! Unfortunately, you can’t delete messages, because voiceover freezes and sometimes crashes. I hope it gets fixed in the next update. Also, could you add in the actions roder? This will make it easier for you to delete messages in addition to pressing the edit button. You can flick up and down with one finger to select an action, for example, read, delete, and delete all."
I love this app and I push all my friends to use it. But in a group chat We would really really like the ability to react to messages other ppl sent. It’s really useful in a large chat because ppl often don’t know what to reply or don’t want to send a message for a simple reaction and this can make a chat group feel like it’s dead. I’m convince that adding reaction with help keep more ppl active on this app.
"As a manager, Telegram has been really useful to my musicians and I for sending song files back and forth in an uncompressed manner. However, lately, it seems like the music player & playlist controls have disappeared from the app, which were integral to my usage behaviors. In addition to that, now some WAV files seem to not load anymore. If I can’t load the files my musicians send me, I’ll have no choice but to use a different app. Is there a glitch or something right now with audio?"
I enjoy telegram. My only issue is every time one of my phone contacts joins a new chat is automatically created with that person. I find this to be such an odd feature as I don’t have open blank texts with everyone in my phone... so why would I want that with anyone I know that joins Telegram? I don’t have a problem deleting the chats I just think this is an odd feature that I would super appreciate the Telegram developers adjust. Thank you for making a safe open platform!
"I downloaded the Telegram app after the nazi secret police of Apple and Google became the thought police of our country when they collided to pull down Parler. Telegram is easy to use, effective and helps keep me Informed (which it’s easy to see the political left in these companies IS NOT). Telegram will serve you well until the bedwetters of Apple decide they know what’s best. No matter though folks, you cannot contain us. Get Telegram you’ll enjoy it."
"I’ve tried many messaging apps and Telegram is my favorite by far. No more spam and advertising to deal with, it’s fast, not data intensive (uses less mobile data than any others I’ve used) and the most secure.  Finally the emoji content is the best by far.  Thanks to the developers for their hard work in maintaining & improving while sticking to the app’s original intent; to be fast and secure."
"You allow on your app to show pornographic content without women’s consent and it is stated by law that without the effective consent of the depicted person, the person intentionally discloses visual material depicting another person with the person’s intimate parts exposed or engaged in sexual conduct so therefore your app is engaged in illegal exposure to women and that is also considered revenge porn which is also illegal. If your app does not wish to have any further consequences I suggest you take a closer look as to the people who use your app to fix the bugs that somehow allow illegal actions or I myself will take further action to have your app completely removed."
"Telegram is my favourite app , i wish from you guys to add a video call feature witch also can be with multiple people ,also for the voice calls.
Something else i wish if you make a feature when only the admins of the channel’s can see their names , let it be a choice of three ...1- if we want to let the subscribers see our name 2- not wanting them to see 3- only admins can see .
I hope you guys take me opinions with consider, thank you."
"Hello
After updating,  the app does not open on my iPhone 5 iOS 10.3.4 !
I deleted the app and install again and reset the phone but does not help . It was ok before update . I have it on my desktop but not on my phone now , 
What should I do ?!!  Help plz
Now I do install the last version 5 of the app and it works! So this version is not compatible with iPhone 5 iOS 10.3.4 !!! Whyyyy?????"
"Unfortunately, all attempts I've made to get BotFather to accept my commands have failed. On the web app, I get an error that I need to be Admin to send commands to BotFather when I click on the BitFather command links. On desktop and mobile, there are no links and no reply feature. Opening the context menu shows all but ""Reply"". It's been a nightmare trying to find a similar problem in tech forums and this is prolly my last attempt to find a solution to this. I'm trying here to see if the developer can provide some support before I abandon the entire idea."
"I’ve been using Telegram with my husband as our messaging platform for a while and really like its clean and simple interface. We tried a different service for a month and decided to go back to Telegram because it was a recognized app on CarPlay. However, a week after we went back, the latest update to the app no longer had CarPlay support so we’re back to using SMS or WhatsApp to communicate on the go in the car. It’s unfortunate because Telegram is our preferred platform. Will update stars depending on this month’s update. Please bring back CarPlay!"
"I have one chat with very important person for me I had lots of memories/photos with. I know it sounds weird but it was so important for me to keep our messages as memories about that person, that he existed in my life. Now I found out that he deleted the whole chat with me and I also don’t have these messages too (it works without my consent, which is so sad and bad!!!). I feel empty right now. 

Please, leave the function which allows to delete the chat only for ONE person (not for both), but consider removing “delete the chat for me and ...”. This is so unfair. Thank you."
"Hello. I spotted two very minor bugs with this version (5.11) of the Telegram app.

First bug: there is a dead “Privacy Policy” link. If the user disables access to contacts, the app will display a page which leads the user out of the app and to the settings area of the iOS device. In this page there is a “Privacy Policy” link. Clicking on this link does nothing - it is a dead link.

Second bug: when the user disables camera access, they are still able to bring up a black camera screen. This is a common feature with many iOS apps - you aren’t accessing the camera of the device, but you are displaying the flash, camera button, and forward-facing camera option on a black screen. In this screen, if the user presses the forward-facing camera icon, the app will become completely frozen. 

Please fix both of these bugs, if possible. Thank you."
