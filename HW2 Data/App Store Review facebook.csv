"I have been flagged so much it’s like what Facebook. Half of the time when I’m flagged it does not even make sense as to why. One minute I’m not following the music rules then I go read the rules and ask what did I do wrong after making the announcement that I don’t own right to music I’m playing while workingout. Then it’s in showing nudity by sharing a link to an advertisement that FB sent to me, I go back to look no nudity everything covered but I still was flagged for sharing a link they sent to me. There is no way to really dispute these so called flags and if you do it will just remain pending and still follow you. This babysitting of adult accounts is crazy especially if it’s not being done by real people and simply by “trigger words”. Get it together and make this a place where I can express myself freely again as long as I am not picking on others and harassing them on their page I should be able to post. Instead of restricting people post on their own pages how about when others report them saying they are offended they are forced to tell their “friend” they ain’t like the post or have them forced to be removed from the “friend” page that is always triggering them. Somethings got to give. Facebook is such a hassle now a days!"
"I have a fairly recent iPhone updated with latest iOS and have had so many issues for a long time now. I’ve had the Facebook app on my phone since I got it(who hasn’t!) recently I decided to take a social media hiatus (we all need to!) and deleted the Facebook app completely from my phone. If I logged on I used the browser but it was slow and I couldn’t do the same things such as upload/share/comment certain pics or videos so I decided to re-download the app last night. Now the entire time it was off my phone I didn’t have one single issue with my phone. Now that I have Facebook back on my phone I’ve had nothing but problems. Other apps freezing or completely exiting out of the app while I’m using it even my messages are messing up sending duplicates or just keeps bumping the same message to the bottom of the screen like I just sent it over and over. Why would my phone work perfectly without it and then the second it’s back I can’t do anything 🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨 what’s up zuck! Why is your app interfering with my phone so bad! Highly considering ditching the whole of social media all together now. Bad app!
Note: my phone has no physical damages it is not cracked or broken as it’s spent it’s whole life since unboxing in an otterbox case with a screen protector I have had diagnostics run on it and there were no issues with my internal systems or my connections to networks. The Facebook app is the only thing that changed."
"I used to enjoy Facebook. Now it has become a mediocre social media site with an even worse app interface. Half of the perks and or extras don’t work in it anymore. The GIF keyboard is blank now! So you can’t even use it. My app is up to date and so app version is not the issue. As if that weren’t bad enough, I have to scroll through Ad after ad after ad after ad for well over five minutes before I can even see posts from friends or family. I do not allow Facebook to track any of my offsite activities because then they show you EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING that you have shopped for, scrolled past, etc.. in the last month! There are so many more social media sites on the web, with apps for them, that don’t police your every move! I was banned for 4 days for sharing a story from 18 years ago about some pervert that assaulted an older lady in the grocery line in front of me, who then stepped up to my daughter who was 5 at the time. I am no coward, but I am a momma bear! So, you can picture where that went! Anyhow, If you are looking for a genuine social media app, that supports or even allows Christian values, or conservative opinions, THIS APP IS NOT FOR YOU! I would recommend GETTR, TruthSocia, Gab, CloutHub or anything else but Fakebook! Don’t give this Section230 arrogant elitist the opportunity to take away your Constitutional Rights any longer! There are so many options for Social Media that are actually enjoyable"
"Facebook’s ever changing “community standards” leave the doors open to violations, account suspensions and even account removals based on posts that are often one, two or as much a seven years old.  Like writing a ticket for running a stop sign to someone years before the sign was even installed.  Not to mention, the so called “community standards” are interpreted by software and not actual humans, so the level of accuracy is ridiculously high.  Certain words now trigger censors, that are common descriptors in different settings, but result in suspensions or post removals.  The term “fatty” in the fishing community is a compliment to describe a great looking fish someone has caught, but it now results in posts being flagged on fishing community pages.  The term “grammar nazi” to describe those who have nothing to contribute to a post but to correct someone’s grammar, spelling and punctuation….banned.  And if someone doesn’t like how a discussion is going, all they have to do is report you as a “bully” or “harassment” and you get flagged in the system….doesn’t matter the content of your posts.  
“Private Groups” are subject to the same rules, despite having agreements with members regarding the kind of content that will be posted and that is acceptable.   And “public groups” can no longer edit out who they want to join as FB allows everyone to join and SPAM the groups. 
And don’t bother trying to use Marketplace on an iPad…it crashes EVERY TIME."
"I loved Facebook Marketplace, but now it has been “upgraded” and has so many glitches!  No user support either.  How can you not have a category to list Garage Sale, but you have a category for search of Garage Sale?  That makes no sense!  How does anyone get their ad listed under garage sale?  Also, adding a date range for garage sale listings (and frankly for all listings) would help so much.  I can’t tell you how many times I inquire on something only to be told the garage sale was months ago, or the item sold and they forgot to take the ad down.  If you had an expiration date, that would be helpful to everyone.  No customer support is huge.  People get flagged for listing a Seagull statue because it is against community standards to sell animals!  It is not an animal, it is a cement statue!  These bans or rejections need a real person to review and help customers.  If someone does break a standard, please tell them exactly what is wrong, not some obscure “bot” response.  Also, the new avatar is horrible!  The old one that was a “comic” version was much better.  If we wanted a realistic avatar we would use a photograph!  Please integrate a group of real end users in to your project team for upgrades or enhancements.  I don’t know what Project Manager is running your upgrades, but they sure can’t be PMP certified because they don’t follow any of the standard project rules!"
"FB is how I keep connected with all sorts of people I had lost contact with, but I’m getting fed up.  The algorithms that decide what I see are awful and I miss I lot.  I usually switch to the Recent view which does a better job, but still filters, but with every new release that gets more cumbersome to get to.  Here’s an example:  yesterday was my birthday, so I figured I’d see my birthday wishes at or near the top this morning.  I saw several ads and then a ton of other stuff.  I never did find them in my feed — I had to go to notifications and tapped on one of the notifications telling me I got a birthday wish which took me to my greetings.  I’m sorry, but even if they weren’t birthday wishes, shouldn’t I be immediately seeing posts that just happened yesterday?  One of my greetings had an avatar in it and a link for me to follow if I want to make an avatar too.  I followed it and it said my app is out of date (which is strange since I have auto-update set on apps) and took me to the App Store were it did *not* show any updates to be installed.  I deleted the app and re-installed it, thinking that should fix it, but it didn’t.  Since FB has no customer support (I guess they think they’re perfect so they don’t need it) there’s nothing to do.  I can try to make an avatar on another device and hope it shows up on my iPad, but that’s it."
"I use Facebook primarily for the market place, which by itself is an awesome platform. It’s much more user friendly and less fee driven than Etsy. That is where the good ends I’m afraid. The app and messenger sidecar constantly have issues updating, showing correct information, presenting errors, not sharing between devices, and show “unread” messages. The updating issues stem from updated listing items. Items on discount don’t always show to the public. I get messages that there are offers on items or that an item has sold and marketplace won’t let me connect to those messages. You have to really really dig to find them. There isn’t a way to filter unread messages and a whole host of notifications give you an unread message notification. If I contact someone about their item and they sell it to someone else or mark it pending I get a message notification but unless I find the exact conversation, that someone sold an item on, it remains in the corner. It can be hard to keep up with actual buyers when the notifications are just red herrings most of the time. For the amount of money Facebook makes and hopefully a whole team of well payed programmers it employees it is ridiculous the amount of issues on the app. Don’t even get my started on the ipad version, you can’t even use it in tandem with your commerce account."
"Facebook used to be a fun place to connect with old school friends and family..a place where I could freely express my unique self. You used to be able to post anything you wanted whether it was true or not, just because you felt like it and nobody really cared! Some things opened up great discussions! Now, everything you share or comment is scrutinized by behind-the-screen random, ghost people. These people have their own opinions and when you freely express yourself like before, your posts or comments will be taken down, blocked or hidden, and all of your audience will be notified that your opinion or posts just happens to be something they personally disagree with. I did a test and posted 2 polar opposite opinions on an issue just to see what they would do, both of them were false news. The fake news I posted about current and political events had 2 distinct viewpoints. The one the ghost person disagreed with, was covered up and labeled as false with a link to an article for my audience to click proving their viewpoint. The other one that was also fake news, fit their personal viewpoint and they never touched it. I personally disagreed with both things I posted but found out quickly what the viewpoint was of the ghost robots behind the screens reading everybody’s personal stuff. Facebook is NOT a good thing!!"
It has gotten so bad with monitoring which I can understand within reason but I have been on there for 1 million years I never threaten … I stay out of arguments and I stay away from anything that Facebook has to offer because I have already been scammed a number of times they monitor you but they don’t monitor the number of people that are hacking other peoples accounts. That’s just one issue the issue is really go on… Now it’s a very leftist communist type of platform that you can only wish people happy birthday a happy anniversary congratulations my deepest sympathy an engagement just simple things things like that.   Get into politics or controversial  issues  they are censoring you and if they don’t like what you say or do or watch … they will extra watch everything you do… just so they can punish you until you behave accordingly to Facebook and their rules. They were never this bad if you get the app you’ll see for yourself but it’s very disappointing it’s an end to an era with Facebook for me.  And I’m glad. They are very sick people and they have nothing but sick of people running it. Yes it’s an opinion but it’s also been my experience. If you do join I wish you all the luck you’re gonna need it.  Just behave the way they want you to and you shouldn’t have a problem …. At least for a while. 🙄🙄🙄
"Help!!! 
I’m having a huge issue with being able to edit my photos and move them to certain albums 😞
Up until last year it was pretty easy to do. During the year I would just upload them and it would go into “mobile uploads “ as a default album. Then at the end of the year I would create an album labeled for that year (ex: 2019) and move all those photos over to that new album. I did it this way because I didn’t like the way it showed up on the news feed if I moved them to a specific album from jump. At the beginning of 2020 I went to move all of my photos to a new album labeled 2020 and everything was different with the editing process. I can’t move most of my pictures because there was more then one photo posted. And I can no longer select more then one photo to move at a time. I waited nearly an entire year hoping this would be corrected but today I checked and it’s still an issue. Can we get this corrected by any chance?? 🙏🏽 I’m a little bit of an organization freak and am totally bummed I can edit my photos the way I used to! 😫 Especially now that I have a son and wanna keep up with each year of pictures correctly."
"The quality of this platform has seriously degraded!! Both functionally and morally. I used to feel relatively “safe” using this platform. NOW, it’s trash! Parts of it don’t even work properly (marketplace has been crashing for months, for example). Also, there’s problems with fake accounts, stolen accounts with NO channels to reach out to make a claim, the company itself is NOT concerned with your privacy or human/constitutional rights—you’re hushed and restricted with the “THREAT” of account deactivation if you’re not “in line” with “community standards”, you can’t post or comment certain things i.e. patriotism, opinions of politics, expressions of attraction to others, activities you’re involved in like events or organizations you might be involved in, even certain locations of restaurants or other venues have gotten people UNWARRANTED violations and blocked for days…to name a few. This “place” used to be better. Every time a safety issue arose, the team seemed to pounce on it instantly. Every safety concern could be found in settings and addressable by users. If another platform comes around that can achieve better ratings, I’m taking ALL of my intellectual property along with EVERY other user (friends and family) I can convince to a SAFER and FREEDOM PRESERVING platform. I’m rating it with ONE star, but it would get a -1 (negative ONE) if that was possible."
"I am also an iPhone user and been having huge issues with the Facebook App. My phone is always up to date. Currently my Facebook app is not working on my phone or iPad. I can access Facebook through a browser but it is not a fun experience as another rater has expressed. One of the biggest issues I have is that the only game I play is Disney Emoji Blitz and I used to save my progress through Facebook. Somewhere along the way something changed either with Facebook ( This whole Meta thing?) or with Disney Emoji Blitz (That they now allow users to save to your iCloud because not everyone uses Facebook anymore?) and the two apps no longer seem to be working well with each other. When I only used the iCloud to save progress the Facebook app started working again and that lasted for a few weeks until Disney Emoji Blitz kept having me back-up through Facebook. I relented and with-in a week the Facebook stopped working again. I think the Facebook app is the source of communication issues between apps and someone needs to start working on this issue.    
* Also...  The only way I can get the Facebook App to work while still being linked with Disney Emoji Blitz is to sign off Wi-Fi and use only Data Usage... This is not right since it can possibly effect our phone plan..."
First your freedom of speech is under attack. 30 days and permanent bans for a joke an adult should be able to make. If they don’t agree with you on issues like Kyle rittenhouse. Guess what? Silenced and banned. I’ve got a few friends it happened too. So you are now being manipulated into facebooks I’m sure “liberal” opinion. It’s less liberal and more nazi. It’s gotten to the point you can’t even defend yourself or it’s bullying. Burning books? Try banning music. Even prisoners have the right to art. Which is what a meme is it’s also expression and free speech. Which they are slowly pulling out from under you. These days to be on Facebook you should be straight edge white wealthy well behaved. Do you like funny things? Not Facebook. Get ready for dry humor only a Normy could love. They deleted and banned the good stuff. Eventually Facebook will over step and it has for many already. Then a new social media will take its place. I’ve already been trying some other options. They think because they are popular they can just step on everyone’s rights and success will continue. It’s not. Facebook doesn’t even have a right to judge people do to how it was profiting on human trafficking and prostitution. That’s why they are rebranding as meta. To slip out of the trouble they should have to be punished for… no 30 no perma ban.
"When Facebook askes the question
 “What’s on your mind?”, they don’t actually mean that! We have all watched Facebook become absolutely tyrannical in the last 18 months as they are desperately trying to stop the truth from being exposed. Facebook used to be a safe place of free expression and a place to be able to discuss thoughts and ideas. Facebook is losing it’s purpose as a place to communicate even with friends and family. Everything that we say is censored even down to the smallest infractions. They are not even the slightest a bit concerned about Americans having freedom of speech to discuss freely among each other today’s most important issues. Anybody with an opposing view is immediately censored and discredited by their so-called fact checkers. The same “fact” checkers have been repeatedly and openly disproven on many occasions. Facebook refuses to offer a fair and balanced platform for all to share their ideas. They have made an all out war against anyone who disagrees with their agenda. They are against anything that is good moral whole true or virtuous. I have seen peoples pages disappear altogether without having any warning or previous bans. They simply tried to log in one day and their account was gone! 
this is an evil company with an evil agenda. I would not recommend anybody use this app."
"Rating this 1 because like all popular social media sites FB is a cess-pool. The entire pandemic they sit there and ban people who discuss the lab-leak theory then we find out that is likely where it came from. They ban people who speak about cloth masks not helping and then we find out that cloth masks are basically useless all along. Those “crazy conspiracy theorists” have been right all along. I’ve known for years that FB is just another arm of the government and their massive propaganda machine but now finally others are speaking/waking up. They censor movements based around freedom while promoting large corrupt organizations such as big pharma. They censor patriots, veterans and real people while allowing pedophiles and communist bots to operate freely and form private groups to talk about god knows what in. They’ve totally brainwashed generations with hateful rhetoric, caused genocides and propped up tyrannical governments, censored material related to corruption within the mega rich and elite, and the list is honestly never ending. Facebook is a stain on democracy along with twitter, instagram, and reddit. They support communists and authoritarianism while spreading hate towards free and open societies. I rarely use fb anymore but felt the need to come and do my part to make their 2 stars a little lower."
"My buissness was heavily promoted via my Facebook and a big part of my success. I’ve been locked out of my account in an eternal loop of trying to recover - I’ve had my identity verified countless times by ID and Passport , but because the hacker enables 2 factor with out my cell phone or other accessible accounts - I can not get in . It’s been over 6 months of me attempting various ways to get help with what seems to be a system error and I can’t get help. I have wedding photos and memories that were lost on other devices in the past I can not access or download now that I have a stable computer to store them on. It is so heart breaking . I keep thinking I’ll get in and now it won’t recognize any of the only 4 devices I’ve logged into it from for the last 3-4 years. 
This app is dying with how many others suffer the same issues and it’s so disappointing to not have any line of support for these problems . The help page does not resolve the issue , we still need actual tech support . I’m not sure where else to put reach too as I attempt again to regain access to a page that helped generate clientele I had been building on for 6 years with… SOS… download all your data and try a more secure app that won’t make it impossible to regain access."
"Somehow, your app gets worse and worse. Now, pages aren’t loading. If I try to look at a friends page, it won’t load. Including my page. Most times, comments won’t load. It’s so glitchy that I could go on and on. But, why? You don’t read complaints anyway. As you can see, I’ve mentioned many of the same things a few weeks ago. Which proves the point. You are making your app trash worthy. When I open an article, or a picture, it freezes and there is no way out. If I want to read comments, I have to go in and out several times in order to do so. I try to look at a friends profile, their posts won’t load. So many other things to list, but, I doubt that you read any of the complaints I see here. It’s become a pain instead of a social media vehicle. Someone mentioned birthdays. Why would you hide that? To the person who wrote the same thing, search for birthdays. How ridiculous. Here’s a big one..there are so many scammers on Facebook. They are creating their own posts, and asking where people live. Then selling Congratulations! You’ve won $750!! after each post. I report them and you see nothing wrong with it? It’s dangerous. No protection on your app. Too much. You are a fraud."
"The winter of 2020 I open a new Facebook account. For a few weeks I was getting pop up air messages that I wasn’t allowed to use any of the emojis for liking, love , care, dislike of a post. Then,Late in the evening On March 22,2022, while I was on my Facebook account, out of nowhere my account was locked! I try for several hours trying to access my account. Nothing was working!!! Because my Facebook account is locked so is my messenger account! Then on top of all that, there is no person to contact , no person to complain to, it’s all done automatically. Today, March 23,2022, I deleted both apps for Facebook and messenger since I couldn’t access either one. I try to open a new Facebook account, no luck! 
All’s I ever posted to My Facebook account was about spreading awareness about all sort of different species of animals, the earth, moons, and sun. Positive thoughts and uplifting memes . I was connecting with so many people from around the world who had sanctuaries, rehabilitate and release programs for animals, vet hospitals, rescuers, sharing artist beautiful art work. All of my contacts on Facebook i don’t have any other way to get in touch with them.

I wasn’t posting lies or propaganda of any extreme political views or religion. I am very perturbed, very annoyed by all this. I just do not know what to do!!"
"I hate Facebook. If I could give Zero stars I would. It’s like school popularity all over again for adults. Only reason I have to have it is cuz I sign into apps with it and I’m so far committed to these apps it would be a huge hassle to start a different account.

I’ve been cyber bullied/harassed/threatened countless times on here but as soon as I respond (fire with Fire), I’m always getting banned/restricted. It’s unreal. Like I seriously hate Facebook and everything it stands for at this point. I can’t wait until a different Social Media provider takes down Facebook. Instagram over Facebook all day any day. Bring back MySpace but FB can get bent for all I care.

Edit: it’s funny I see a lot of the same complaints. Something tells me FB won’t be around for 2030. Ding dong the witch is dead. Facebook doesn’t realize it yet, probably cuz they are full of themselves, but y’all on the downhill swing of things. Enjoy your last run. 1 star reviews are piling up and y’all don’t care. Bullies. But I think it’s time I finally take the plunge and create a Twitter as my primary and use that for my app accounts. Facebook, you had your chances and your nothing but a bully yourself that allows bullies to thrive while restricting the people who simply defend themselves from these bullies, hence, your ALSO A BULLY."
i tried making a facebook status and it won’t even let me do that anymore!! it said i was “misusing a feature by going too fast” (even tho i literally wasn’t going too fast at all i was going at a perfectly normal pace!!!) and that i was blocked from using it!! wouldn’t even tell me how long i was blocked from posting. it wasn’t like a regular post block and it was for no reason because like i said i was not going too fast. i was literally just trying to chose a sticker/feeling/activity for my status like i have been doing for years. never had an issue with this specific feature on fb til now. got a pink slip-looking message saying that i’m blocked from “using this feature” whenever i would try to post at all. couldn’t comment or anything. all for trying to post NORMALLY. no swear words or spam or even any links or anything in the status. it was a normal facebook status. i’ve been posting normal facebook statuses like this for like 14 years and all of the sudden i’m told im going too fast when picking a sticker/feeling/activity??? we need a new platform because this is NOT the only problem and i am NOT the only one with problems here!! also i get it’s been rebranded as meta but i refuse to get into the habit of always calling it that omg
"I’m great full to Facebook for ability to keep in touch with friends and understand they maintain a free platform. The continual and complex privacy features seem to be largely a CYA action to cover up FB own intrusion to privacy while managing to restrict freedom of speech at same time🤥 (as I currently reload one account to gain access to manage photos feature). I’ve never seen so many scam and MLM marketing advertisements as the ones forced into my newsfeed, sponsored marketplace ads (even if I choose local PU only!) ...the sheer number of obvious fake FB account friend requests (seriously, NO photos, NO friends🤪😜…and constantly ignoring my preference Not to have friend requests or suggestions from these accounts!). When scam, for profit obscure “fundraisers” are called out in comments...FB allows the companies to moderate and delete the comments...admittedly it’s a tough issue to vet advertisers- so why not let customers post feedback in comments...or have a link to public records of alleged performance of “for profit” fundraising companies hiding behind legitimate non-profits? 

Sorry to rant, could go on...but I do have hope for the future...and can’t wait for more competitive platforms to develop!"
"DELETED my facebook account after 10 years of opening my account. Will never want to be related to any platform/product that is associated with them. Yeah, I still have instagram and whatsapp but now I have decided to almost NEVER use them. This is the most deceptive company you will ever encounter in your life, so for you to constantly give up your personal data sounds bonkers to me. Many of us unsatisfied users are totally aware of the many scandals that Facebook has been involved with. From privacy breaches to denying the harmful effects that their platforms have had on their users. Also, Facebooks platforms used to be platforms for “freedom of expression” and now they have become all about trying to manipulate and control users thoughts and emotions. It is becoming increasingly easy for these companies to almost dictate the way that you live your life (what you like, believe, want etc.) because the more data they have about you, the better the ability that these platforms have to influence and shape who you are and who you will become. Finally, they are starting to seem more and more tyrannical to me because now it seems so apparent to me that they are all about censoring anything that disagrees with “them” whoever them is. So for those reasons, I am out!"
"Facebook won’t allow me to log into the app, nor messenger or Instagram(since they’re all ran by the same people). It all began at the exact same time, before the end of last year. I’ve reached out to the support team, as well as other people, and they all say the same thing. “Delete and re-install,” “change password,” “check possible mistyped information.” The thing is, NOTHING IS WRONG. I still have the same phone-number. I still have the same iCloud account. It says it’s compatible with my iPhone. Yet, I can’t log into any of my social media? I can access the account through a web browser, but I can’t message anyone. I can’t view messages, because I have to have access to messenger for that. Every time I attempt logging into either apps for Facebook it always says the same thing; “unexpected error occurred. Please try logging in again.” And when I try logging into my Instagram, it says the page no longer exists. IVE BEEN SHOWN MY PAGE BY OTHER PEOPLE. IT VERY WELL STILL EXISTS. I never disabled it. I never deleted it. It simply says it doesn’t exist even though it does. I’ve been banned from all platforms. And it’s frustrating because I have family from different countries that I contact. I haven’t been able to speak to them in over a year now…"
"So the app keeps getting updated but these updates are making the app worse and worse.. When I save things to watch later, the “collection” I put them in doesn’t auto play, so I can’t just put it on while I’m cooking because I have to select the next video in the list each time.. Also when I remove videos, magically they play over again?? I can’t react to most videos.. only two videos load at a time.. This ain’t due to my WiFi, either.. Videos still don’t stay paused when I set my phone down.. And I keep seeing a notification for messenger when I’m on Facebook but I won’t have any messages or notifications when I go into the messenger app.. So basically Facebook has become a Broken system & your employees must not actually work or they’re purposefully making these awful changes to annoy people to stop using Facebook.. If I could keep in contact with my Ohana afar any other way besides Facebook, I would never use the app again.. Oh and can we please make dark mode available for all users, or at least add it to all iOS devices?? Please let me know if I’m reviewing for nothing because you’re not actually paying attention or reading the reviews so I can post these complaints straight to my wall instead.. Mahalo.."
"Ok, since Facebook has no way for us to contact them unless it’s directly through our account, which I currently cannot access, then my email will probably not reach them. Hopefully this will. 
DEAR FACEBOOK PEOPLE: So I created an account and a page literally two days ago. I tried doing an ad for my page yesterday, and because I did it too early (I think this is why) my ads account was flagged. I did everything as I was told: I sent in a review request and they fixed the problem, unflagging my ads account, so they sent me an email to confirm that all was well again. However, I cannot access either my account or my page anymore. It’s as if they don’t exist. Apparently the problem was already fixed but I can’t see anything I previously put on my account and page.
Furthermore, I can’t make a new account because my email is tied to my previous account, so I’m pretty much stuck. They tell me that if I need help I should contact the Facebook Support Team but, I repeat, I CANNOT access my account. So I cannot access the FB Support Team. 
This is the first time I ever give something a one star review. I don’t mean to be rude but your customer service is very bad. I can’t even properly delete my account, in case it’s not fully gone. So yeah. SOMEONE PLEASE HELP."
"Similar to other reviews, my account was hacked and immediately disabled. I requested reviews repeatedly but received no response from Facebook, not even confirmation that my requests were received. My business account was also hacked and fraud ads were purchased and charged to my PayPal account. I disputed it with PayPal but they claimed the transactions were authorized since Facebook was an authorized vendor on my PayPal account. Despite the fact that I had not even been able to access my account to purchase ads for weeks and received no invoice. And no word from Facebook when I disputed the transaction with them. I was however lucky to have a good credit union that went to bat for me and got my money retuned.

A heads up to check your PayPal authorizations and delete it along with all Facebook apps from your life. Facebook/Instagram users make this company billions of dollars from sharing their data on their platforms, and buying ads for their business pages, but they could care less about setting up consumer protections for you let alone any customer assistance. This is beyond unacceptable for a global corporation that can afford to do better. Bye forever, Facebook and Instagram. I’ll be taking my data and ad dollars to Twitter."
"The good is when you connect with ppl you normally wouldn’t have or find long lost relatives etc. 

the bad is when someone hacks your page….or if you don’t keep all your photos private and someone steals them to use as a fake profile. I recently came across a fake profile bc of a fake business as someone  was trying to sell me air duct cleaning. Well i went into a serious investigation at 12am and found over 75 fake profiles and 3 fake business pages.  It was pretty obvious to spot how I know they are fake. Then I found the real person that belonged to one of the profiles. I tried to msg the real person and well ppl you don’t know won’t see your msgs right away..they go into a spam folder. I tried to then report the fake page and nothing happened bc it allegedly doesn’t go against their standards even though there was no place to explain why. This site was fun when I was younger but now it’s become too big and too spammy and not that safe anymore. 👎🏻 I hope they see this and re-evaluate all the pages they said they couldn’t do anything abt. It’s ridiculous. Allegedly 2.85 billion use fb but what percentage of that is just fake profiles 🤔"
"I have a personal FB account and have since forever it seems. It was great for years. Now I guess they just are rolling in the money, and don’t really have to communicate in any way or form to their members. I now manage my Father’s business account and have been for over 5 years. In the last 6 months it has spiraled down crazily. They just implemented a Publishing Authorization thing that has literally haunted my ability to post from my computer at all. They also seem to keep creating problems in their system. Because now I cannot post any video from my iPad. Which has been my only way to post, comment, or respond. Since their new publishing authorization thing. I have sent probably 25 feedback messages. Which is basically just a waste of my time, because they are never going to respond in any way. Really wish they didn’t have such a monopoly on the multimedia market. I have never really been into the way Twitter works, but the one time I had a pro and messaged them they responded in a few hours. With a detailed description of what was going on, and some advice about how to fix it. I have even been wanting to delete my personal Fb account because it’s just a waste these days."
"Facebook is an average social media app that is nice for communicating with friends and family for free (via Messenger). But, with that being said, it is time for Facebook to release a major design update for the mobile app. Often, when I am checking the reactions to my posts on Facebook, the reactions never load, are miscounted, or not updated. This is example number one of why Facebook needs to seriously upgrade. One thing that a lot of Facebook mobile app users have been waiting for is a dark mode for the app! It has been released across multiple platforms, including instagram, which is owned by Facebook. They released a dark mode for desktop users & the Messenger app, and it is beyond time for the mobile users to have the option for dark mode on the Facebook App. One last example of something that Facebook needs to update is it’s variety. Messenger only having a few color-themed backgrounds to choose, for example. Other than a design update, the app is very useful for communication, businesses, memes, inspiration, etc. It is also a good way to pass the time."
"I’m not one to write reviews but I’m
overly annoyed. My account was recently hacked which lead to my account being suspended, which then lead to me submitting a review request that was denied. My account was then disabled and there was absolutely NOTHING I could do, everything since 2005, just, gone!! After a few days I was FINALLY able to create a new account, which it wasn’t letting me for the longest time, even when using a different email, but eventually was successful. What I’m most annoyed about is that there were ZERO people to help me, zero!!! There needs to be a customer service team that users have 24/7 access to talk to for help. I’m glad they looked out for my account and disabled it for safety purposes, however, I was also paying for an employment add boosting and wasn’t able to access any of it, but yet they still continued to pull funds until I canceled my card. There just needs to be more help options to speak to someone other than you just reading about what might help or things to try, when you actually have account access. Another thing that’s annoying is I keep getting an error when I try logging into the Facebook associated apps, I have to use everything in a browser, I can’t access the apps anymore. 🤬"
"Facebook was a great way to connect and reconnect with family and friends but then they started to be selective on what people can post. They even had the audacity to put a tag on my grief page about the safety of the V and that Is so unacceptable in addition to the sacrifice made by a fallen soldier that post was offensive yet recently I posted a complaint on offensive brutal beating of someone inciting violence against others and I get we reviewed your complaint and found it doesn’t go against this community standards , really well what are your standards, bullying, threatening, and blocking others who disagree with you. How about blocking people who think for them selves. I’m gonna get a little black book and put my friends and family info in that and leave this behind soon as able to. I’ve been stopped from posting that racism will never end why because it’s to profitable for those who profit off of it.  So many people who are seeing the division and get it this is not good for any of us United we stand divided we fall ask yourself who will benefit if we fall???  Thankful I can think for myself.   Truth Facebook is not where you can openly share have an opinion think for yourself etc. change or be replaced. Talk is going around Facebook is going down."
"FB began censoring content and shutting down related services without providing an explanation or opportunity to resolve a few years ago.  They hired “journalists” to write and publish misleading articles to challenge anything they simply disagree with and employed “fact checkers,” to enforce it.  These “fact checkers” then flag your account for disrupted service which you can never resolve to FB’s satisfaction.  I’m currently still waiting on a review to restore my ability to interface Marketplace.  The review was supposed to take 2 weeks, but it’s been several months now.  My “crime” was sharing other’s widely disseminated posts, there were just two. The first was a legitimate article written by an actual journalist who documented another being banned from Twitter. The second was a meme.  It was a photo collage of a politician at official state functions, all from the public domain, not photoshopped.  The individual photos are famous.  Collage or not, they just happened to put the politician in an unflattering light, just like the individual’s gaffe filled speeches and absurd actions on video.  Even reliable constituents of this politician find the photos and collage funny, but not humorless FB.  This platform has become so corrupt it should be comprehensively redesigned and depoliticized or simply shutdown."
"Most users are probably not aware that facebook is designed to make people ignorant. It is designed to make you click and stay on as long as possible in order to sell more ads and make more money. The way they do this is by showing users content they will react to. They can do this by showing them more and more of what they already like. When they do this, they exclude conflicting information. This means that whatever you believe to be true or right (regardless of whether it is actually true or right), will be repeated to you over and over and over and over. It traps users in a bubble of information (or disinformation) and it's brainwashing!  And it makes them money. The other way to get users to react and stay on the platform is to show them things they will react negatively to-like  posts that make them angry enough to dislike or comment on. They will then shower you with similar or related posts to keep you engaged. You will constantly see things that make you angry so you will keep engaging. Who wants to live in a state of constant anger? But you're not even presented with this choice. You are provoked by facebook to keep reacting. It is a horrible, horrible business model that is slowly destroying the fabric of society around the world."
"I have been on Facebook for a very long time. Many years.  I have never ever been suspended, not 1 time.  I also have business pages that I advertise and Boost and have spent thousands on advertising within the past couple of years as well on Facebook! . All of a sudden on November 21st while I was on Facebook, they disabled my account, then they asked me for my picture ID License and then again a picture of me. Which I did right away. I did absolutely nothing wrong.  How can a social media just wipe your entire account out, all your pictures and information and give you absolutely no reason what so ever. We are not China or Cuba or Venezuela to do that to it’s people!!!   The censoring and control to do this to their people on Facebook is a disgrace.  All I am asking is to reopen my account immediately for I did nothing wrong. I do think I was hacked , for maybe that was an issue.  But I sent Facebook my ID etc..   They should get on this immediately and at least email me back to let me know something.  Their fast at suspensions and fast at disabling accounts but they take their time trying to help people in need to get their accounts back to good people who have been on Facebook for years!!  Terrible & a Disgrace!!"
"I hate this app with all my soul. I don’t use Facebook because I don’t like it. But the other day I wanted to play a game and decided to make a Facebook Account to log into the game. I didn’t do anything on this account but play my game. Never friended anyone, posted anything, and spammed.
It came to my surprise a month ago that my account was disabled. I am now unable to play my game that I worked hard on, AND cant get anyone in Facebook to help me. There’s horrible customer service. No phone to call your problems. And they don’t ever list specifically what you did wrong. Just that you don’t follow the “community standards” I tried to recover my account by doing the little thing they make you do. AND it just made it worse and told me they are “sticking with their deduction.” Another option they give you is to submit an ID so they can verify it’s you. I am not comfortable with doing that and it’s unbelievable that’s even an option they have you do just to get your account back. I am very upset. Since they don’t email you or call you this is my last resort. If you want to fix something fix it all, nothings good about this app. I really hope you get locked out of your houses. :)"
I don’t even think I need to say enough about Facebook to know how terrible it is using you’re information to sell to 3rd parties and those 3rd parties manipulating its a crazy way to structure a society!! Because people won’t tell what’s real anymore Facebook was never good the only reason people thought it was good was because it was addictive that’s how MySpace was bought out by Facebook because it was  so addictive yet we as people couldn’t see that when iOS 14.5 rolled out people opted out not to be tracked but Facebook knowing tells you hey let’s keep Facebook free for everyone free is not free it’s just another way of making something terrible think about it the horse and carriage was considered amazing before the car 🚗 comes along same thing with a brick phone everything was great until smart phone arrives the answer isn’t to stop making comparisons because we can’t control that but you have to change the object of you’re comparison from someone else to yourself you have to measure real to real and that’s what Facebook does to you it was never about this attention economy it was never about that when the internet first arrived it was just putting things out their getting creative.
"Several weeks ago, my account was disabled following a intrusion by a hacker who enabled 2FA. I learned of this activity when I woke up on Tuesday, June 1. I immediately changed the password and was able to remove the hackers email. But 2FA was turned on and sent to a device that I do not have access to. I submitted the requested information and ID’s with no response or a response saying that the ID couldn’t be verified even though it is my state issued TN drivers license. After a couple of weeks waiting on a response I was informed that my account had been disabled. When I tried to review it (almost immediately after I got the notification) I was told it what been to long and that the account couldn’t be reviewed. This was surprising, because I have been trying to reach you all everyday for weeks. The hackers then CHARGED my card that is associated with my business account. According to Reddit and other posts they are targeting business owners and Facebook does not help even after I’ve spent thousands and thousands with them. I have contacted them multiple times a a day for the last 6 weeks and now I truly fear I will never get my account, memories, and network back again. Truly devastated."
"Unfortunately I still use it because this is the only major platform everyone uses now. I really hope one day soon it will fold though. I’ve been in fb jail three times for 30 days each for the same type of posts but they actually have not broken any “rules” just pictures, no wording nothing else to go by that would flag the post. I assume it’s someone reporting it continuously but regardless they immediately stick my profile on restricted without justification. And even then will not respond when you appeal it. They ignore everything and blame it on Covid. Worst community standards EVER, worst customer service EVER because there is NONE, and I am so glad they lost money during stocks drop! Of course they are based in California so I expect no better. Everyone gets asshurt over there over a pen drop 🙄.. I so wish someone else would create a social media platform with much lesser “rules” and better customer service when you need it. They have 0 respect for the people in Ukraine and even the President of the Ukraine, they flag every news post about them as “false” and under “fact checkers watch” when most of all information has actually been confirmed to be true. It’s just a very sickening site."
"Last year when things got cantankerous during the election, I decided to change a few things on my profile. My birthday (1958) was hidden from view but I decided to change it to May of 2020 (after all I’ve seen a few friends that are 120 years old on there). BIG MISTAKE. I was IMMEDIATELY blocked from FB and messenger for being “under 13 years old!” They sent me a message to respond to if I thought this was done in error. I sent them a picture of my FL drivers license THREE times with the email being returned saying they couldn’t read it. I opened what I sent and it was clear as day…..a regular JPEG……. Note that there is NO phone number to contact ANYONE at FB and the ONLY email address I could find was the one they kept saying they couldn’t read. All attempts to make another account linked me to my old account so I am still blocked. It’s funny how if I try to open FB it says they are reviewing my account and if they still determine I’m underage they will permanently block me……..but they need ONE day to determine this. Sad that they think a 63 year old individual is only 8-16 months old since I posted several photos with me and my family. I really wonder how all those FAKE Russian accounts aren’t blocked?"
"Facebook has aided in causing division in the world. They should be honored that they had the task of connecting humanity. Instead, they played games with millions of lives. They should be held accountable for the hatred and division they assisted politicians in spreading. Facebook has masked it’s bullying in passive aggressive agenda , masking it in rules, that only applied to one party. Facebook should have been a safe space for each individual to share their beliefs, maybe we the people could have reached a compromise.... bonding in our differences....isn’t that what life is about? Humanity learning how to bridge the gaps? How wonderful it would have been if Facebook book acted as a platform for true connection between ALL parties, a platform where ALL our voices count, a platform where no one’s beliefs are disregarded, a platform where we make amends in our differences. It’s not about manipulation, it’s about being honest and transparent and learning to work together. Work together, work together, work together.....through all our differences and beliefs.....work together...Facebook you where supposed to be glue for humanity , neutral, glue is neutral- it doesn’t pick sides. Facebook knows it’s influence, they don’t get to act like they don’t know."
"I’ve been using Facebook religiously since 2009, back in July someone hacked my Facebook and Instagram, since they were intertwined, and there was NO physical way for me to get it back since they changed my email, password, and number. When reported I get a notification on my new facebook saying that someone reported the profile because they’re claiming/ pretending to be me but then y’all reply saying that they are me and they didn’t cross any community guidelines. They had been sending a picture of my drivers license to people through messenger trying to scam them and I’ve received messages being cussed out because my old profile “ripped them off”. 

Really only keeping it around because that’s how I keep up with friends since they’ve gone all over the place since graduation. I lost pictures, conversations with friends that have passed, and things that I’ve been sharing/ memories I had made as “statuses” over the last 12 years. If y’all want it “poppin’” like it use to be, you need to take what complaints are out there into consideration and fix it. Also need to monitor for scammers when reported and do something about it. 👌🏻"
"Old Facebook was so much better. It needs to be said. My main issue today is that nothing is loading. Not sure why. Errors all over the app. However, their entire self policing thing is.... a mess. I have been put on post bans for things that do follow the community guidelines, however if I report someone saying something genuinely awful like... okay the most recent... so a friend shared a post about a family that had lost their trailer in a fire. Thankfully they were not there, but they lost everything and have a baby. Do they were asking for donations for... everything. And someone posted that an abortion would take care of the babies needs. The baby is several months old and even if it wasn't that is not something you say to someone who is pregnant. Nothing was done. However I got hit because I was trying to correct someone's ignorance about why Rome failed with a link to an article written by actual historians and got marked as spam. If all my friends weren't on here, I wouldn't use it. I use it specifically to stay in contact with friends and mindless meme posting."
"I had left facebook about four years ago because I’d found myself spending too much of my free time worrying about what other people think of me. Frankly, it’s been blissful being free of social media, but I’ve grown to appreciate the value of being connected to friends who are otherwise unreachable. I do miss them. However, I will never be returning to facebook again, nor any other mainstream social media platform. Why? Because like most things nowadays, thanks to, um... (cough cough) current events, facebook is no longer about connectivity and self expression. It has become precisely what George Orwell has been warning us about for ages. Their constant censoring of perfectly valid questions and concerns of safety have made that apparent. I pity anyone who has tried speaking their mind, speaking the truth, and been censored and even deplatformed as a result. The truth needs to be broadcast for all to hear, now more than ever! It doesn’t even matter if what an individual is saying is relevant or not! They have the right to say it! And the right to say it uncensored! So I am giving facebook this horrific review in the hopes that changes will be made. In the hopes that free speech, and freedom itself, will be restored. 
Sincerely,
Vincent Mandi"

So much has changed about fb  when I first downloaded the app I absolutely loved how you can stay connected with family and friends but somehow the very core of that has gone missing. Now you have to pay to be seen ! On both Instagram and fb !! I see the same 7 ppl on my timeline but some how I have 5000 active friends. I can post daily and won’t be seen how can a small business even be seen without the burden of coming out of pocket just to still not be seen unless you come out of pocket daily! As an African American I definitely feel RED LINE when using this app ! And I definitely don’t feel like it’s equal opportunity on all the major social media especially this one . When we try to “ pull ourselves up by the boot straps “ we are constantly systematically STOPPED speaking from my own experience! and I’m rarely one to speak on things like this but however it did prompt me to leave a review. Hopefully things can change for the better. To think an app that was supposed to connect us with family and friends are doing everything in their power to stop us from connecting
"It’s like they’re trying to make it addictive or confusing or something, you will constantly get notification badges but when you open the app there’s either no notifications or it’ll be 5 or 6 notifications flooding your feed saying “John Doe uploaded a new picture “ and don’t think turning the notifications off for that will help you because it only turns it off per person and you can only turn it off when it sends you one of those notifications.
The app is buggy and crashes without notice on iPhone X/11 and they will ban you for just about anything and will not read the post or other comments for context, even in review. If your plan is to stick to groups no luck there either! It only takes one jerk posting something he’s not supposed to to shut a group down and it’s so bad that half of them have “DO NOT REPORT, EVEN TO ADMINS” in the group rules. They just want you to comment “Admin” and hope they see it. Also no custom scripts or bots like on Reddit, the only bots are ones that have been bought and paid for with the express purpose of bringing out the racist/ stupid side of the conservatives in your family. Seriously, I’d take 2004 MySpace over modern Facebook."
"Not to mention you allow Marxist groups to threaten the lives of me and my family and my daughter. And when I report malware from people who are stealing other peoples identities like Dan Bonginos And you still allow the malware to be posted in peoples names to be tagged in it. Maybe you should quit your day job and go to something that you actually know how to control. If that’s possible The date now is February 25, 2021. I have yet again to be blocked for another 30 days for the same exact post. It goes a bit their privacy policy and their terms and conditions. I’ve already looked it up they’re going against their own lawful description on what you can cannot do you on Facebook. Facebook is one of the most Nazi Controlled community platforms I have ever been on. They are not a public platform they are a publisher they will censor and discriminate and take any post you put on down any kind of opinion you have whether it be conservative or liberal your discriminated against I recommend nobody under the age of 18 be on there and I recommend anyone over the age of 18 find a better source to communicate. Facebook is nothing but crap!"
"Let me tell you the story of when there was a brief moment of global happiness on October 4th, 2021. It was when Facebook, the overlord, went down for 7 hours. People began to truly live again. But alas, this was a false hope. For the first time in more than a decade, the warriors of Khey Boerd were forced to lay down their arms. The trolls in the realm of Mohm’s Baesmehnt were silenced. The Khareen’s had nowhere to nag and cry (at least where others could hear them). The Left Kingdom and Right Kingdom could no longer slander each other. And as the people in both kingdom’s were released from the trance they had been bound under; they realized that the overreaching lords of their kingdom’s were the true enemy. But alas, as quickly as the spark of hope came into being it was snuffed out again. The underpaid and overworked minions of the overlord Facebook soon took action. This caused almost all hope to be lost. Or did it? I urge you brave adventurer, seek to bring back the days of simple social communication between strangers and forsake these over-praised idols of mind control and manipulation. You have tasted of true freedom, now give the same hope to others. Remove the veil of deception from their eyes. Our world depends on it."
"The amount of storage this app takes up on my iPad is insane. I have to constantly delete and re-install it. And whenever I get a notification of something in a group on my iPad, it just takes me to the group, not where the reply to my comment is, making it impossible to find. It doesn’t do that on my phone. I don’t understand. Also I haven’t been able to access one of my business pages forever on my iPad. Everything is there at the top except “posts”.

Update: whenever I go live now it just freezes and goes blurry and tells me bad connection even though my internet is fine. People can’t watch me and I’m losing the viewers I worked so hard to build and the potential to get more. People in groups I’m in have been complaining about the same thing so I know it’s not my internet all of a sudden. Sometimes comments don’t show while I’m live either, which messes with the interaction. This started a couple weeks ago. Also seeing the notification that the same person is watching 6 times in a row has been and ongoing issue for months now. Facebook is by far my favorite social media platform but the useability has been getting worse and worse."
"You used to be able post anything you wanted whether it was true or not, just because you felt like it and nobody really cared! Some things opened up great discussions! Now, everything you share or comment is scrutinized by behind-the-screen random, ghost people. These people have their own opinions and when you freely express yourself like before, your posts or comments will be taken down, blocked or hidden, and all of your audience will be notified that your opinion or posts just happens to be something they personally disagree with. I did a test and posted 2 polar opposite opinions on an issue just to see what they would do, both of them were false news. The fake news posted about current and political events had distinct viewpoints. The one the ghost person disagreed with, was covered up and labeled as false with link to an article for my audience to click proving their viewpoint. The other one that was also fake news, fit their personal viewpoint and they never touched it. I personally disagreed with both things I posted but found out quickly what the viewpoint was of the ghost robots behind the screens reading everybody's personal stuff. Facebook is NOT a good thing!!"
"Facebook is a social media disaster. It only allows positive messaging (like button, love button, applause, wow, etc) so people only get positive feedback on things they post. If someone writes a negative comment about something, people will attack them in the comments and have no repercussions whatsoever, no matter how brutal they are. And they are brutal, because they can hide anonymously behind their keyboards. People say things on Facebook that they would never say in person. If you don’t like someone, fine -block them. Ghost them. Who cares? After all, it’s your Facebook page, why should you have to deal with other people’s crappy opinions?! You end up surrounded by nothing but sycophants and everyone convinces you that your opinions are the right ones. Spoiler alert: you’re not always right. People prefer to be in happy environments with people we trust with our thoughts, opinions and dreams -so we put ourselves in these little bubbles and either never express our opinions for fear of judgment from others or we delete anyone who would disagree with our opinion. You end up with polarized extremists who are brainwashed into thinking that’s normal.  It’s not normal, and it’s destroying us all."
"I have an extremely short last name. It’s literally two letters. My first name (that I wanted to put it) is very short as well. It told me I HAD to put in a last name, of which I really didn’t want to do (because I didn’t want to just flaunt off my last name to people in the world) and it said “yep your last name’s too short and you HAVE to put it there.” Not to mention the fact that when I put in everything and hit “create account,” after filling in just a bunch of letters for a last name, it told me that I already had an account. I’ve never filled an account with Facebook before. I was only creating one so I could contact a store to book an appointment, and to even get in touch with them I not only had to create an account with Facebook, but also download Facebook and the messenger app, simply just to get in contact with a company. Really, Facebook? You can’t make your program user friendly? I WASNT EVEN ABLE TO MAKE AN ACCOUNT!!! And judging from your incredible 2.2 overall star review on the App Store, I’m guessing you guys don’t listen to your consumers. So, thanks, but I would try a different social media app. Not that there’s any good ones out there, anyway."
"Just ask yourself: how does a company which trades in your personal, private business make so much money? Heck, just do a search and see. Social media has been bad for children, adults, entire continents. It’s not hyperbolic, when you think of the number of folks using this service. And Facebook (Meta… good luck with that rebranding PR), of all social media, has been the absolute worst. Users should have figured that out when Zuck laughed about people being stupid, handing over personal, private information. We left FB in 2009 (about the time they claimed copyright over every photo, video, thought, posted) and have looked on from the sidelines as the world just kinda… forgot? how to be civil?  And now FB is just a great place to about into a loud echo chamber with only like-minded. Real growth there, folks. Super job shepherding humanity into the 21st century.  Do yourselves a favor: quit. Free is never free. And Facebook is just plain bad for people. It is. 

(Also, if our personal information is worth so much, why can’t we see it? Why aren’t we allowed to review it? Lastly, why can’t we sell it ourselves? Letting some third party in your home to steal your privacy is just stupid.)"
"I used to love Facebook because you were able to agree with those you didn’t agree with on somethings but now it’s like you have to agree or else get suspended for anything even old posts or comments from long ago. For this I won’t support anything Facebook until there is a new owner or things change to be a neutral understanding. I’m a Trump supporter but agree with both sides. I agree with some democrats thinking but the way things went were corrupted from the leaders just to win. They made the right look as if all were bad. Not all think alike. I love everyone and think we need to come together. No fighting just understanding and doing what’s best. I understand people need to come from other countries, I understand that we need clean air, I understand that we need diversity. But I also understand people need to be aloud to make their own choices and decisions because that’s what freedom is all about.  The left is being tricked to lie cheat and do wrong. That’s not ok look at what they are doing for us now. Nothing. It’s up to us to work together against them and stop letting them make money off of our emotions. Let’s all love each other’s ways and work it out."
"I’ve been in Facebook since it early days. I’ve been able to share my life with friends all over the world and been able to experience their lives as well through our Facebook connection. I’ve discovered old friends and made new friends. Shared my opinion thoughtfully without insulting anyone or being censored because I take the time to understand issues that concern me and base my opinions on facts. I understand that there are ads and posts that I dislike or don’t agree with and choose to ignore, move on or block them. I have the freedom to read what I like and ignore what I don’t like. It is, at the heart of it, social media, it’s a global happy hour, fireside chat, family reunion or political platform. And it works. I don’t blame Facebook for unintelligent posts or some nefarious plan to destroy democracy, not do I blame them for bad cell or wifi coverage. It does what is supposed to do, connect me to people.  5 stars for that. Don’t overthink it people."
"Seriously!?!? I want my whole schedule in ONE place, home, work, fun, and that’s not going to be the Facebook events tab, so if you think I’m going to keep using that to setup, find or advocate for using events, you better go back to making it easier to sync with the iFamily of computing. It used to just automatically sync everything from FB to iCal, no problem. Then about 8-9 months ago, that stopped, and I had to either manually sync events one by one from my phone, or go to a web version of FB, find my calendar, and manually tell it to sync all. And even that doesn’t update any events, which is a pita. 😠 My main device is an iPad. Do you understand the PITA it is to convince safari to fun a web based version of a site? 

Now you’ve gone and “improved” your surfing experience, AND I CAN NO LONGER FIND THE OPTION TO SYNC MY CALENDAR AT ALL. I have already started using other programs to schedule events for my activities that are more user friendly to all OS’s. And I will be recommending to others to do the same. You really need to not make people intertwining FB into their lives in ways they want it harder."
"The Facebook app shows that it was updated today, and now it will not open on my iPad Mini 2, which cannot run iOS 13.  It worked fine yesterday.  Please remember many people are using older devices - which really aren’t that old; I’ve only had this iPad for 3 years - and make sure your app works with the previous version of iOS as well as the current one.  UPDATE:  After reading other reviews, the app evidently doesn’t work on the newest iOS 13, either.  This app needs to be fixed ASAP! If you can’t fix the bug by tomorrow, please roll us back to the previous version!   UPDATE 2:  My phone has now installed the new version of the app and it still opens, so evidently only certain devices are affected.  This is still a big problem and needs an emergency fix!  UPDATE 3:  I followed the advice of another reviewer and deleted the app and reinstalled it; that fixed the problem and it’s working again.  Evidently the data was overloaded.  Why does this app store so much data?  There’s no need to accumulate data on my devices except to save the login cookies and maybe a few login cookies and form info for the built-in browser."
"Coordinating like in share to mislead others about the popularity of something? 🤦🏾‍♂️ I’m not coordinated or miss leading or repeateding comments likes follow or nothing, This doesn’t make sense to me that my video been up September 24th & y’all Waited two months and a half almost 3 months to Block my video smh 🤦🏾‍♂️ This doesn’t make sense to me I have all rights just as well like everybody else as long as I’m not copyrights no one else video etc. It shouldn’t be a big deal as long as I’m the owner of my video and, I’m keep telling y’all, That’s my personal video I owned that video I recorded that when I was downtown a friend of mine was holding my phone why he recorded me…. And original video is still in my photos Savior……So whatever solution y’all trying to come up with I’m not going against none of your rules My video which is only speaking about It’sPositive (too many problems) is the title of the song in was going on around the world…That’s the title of my song so once again that’s my mainly video I own my own video…..Hope you guys understand where I’m coming from……I’m truly hurt because of this I cannot believe that you’re taking away something that I created"
"Facebook has become what separates the masses.  It has become fascist. It’s repeatedly banning users  for dumb reasons. I have been banned for criticism towards some men with the word “men”.  But it seems to never ban when the criticism goes towards women. Women are treated as jokes in this platform and no one gets banned.  Another time I got banned for saying something true about my own country.  Suddenly United States apparently doesn’t have a president now, Facebook was  all over trump and now Biden is not even mentioned. Facebook is Too political and dictatorship-like I really wish we didn’t have Facebook anymore as a tool and we all move together to better platforms completely separate from Facebook.  banned from Facebook a few times , my ads are banned for ever and there is nothing I can do , started getting less views on my Instagram business profile.   Facebook has affected my business because it’s robot community is misinterpreting comments.   Not a good platform anymore, but i still need to use it to at least share some stuff (that get 1 or 2  views suddenly, before it would get hundreds and thousands of views) thanks for ruining my business, Facebook"
"Facebook is biased against Native Americans and other Indigenous groups who are fighting against Black Afrocentric and White Eurocentric Culture Vultures who are trying to erase the identity. History, Civilizations and achievements of Native Americas throughout their homelands. They allow Black racists free reign to spew racist insults at NAs who are merely trying to save their cultures and history from pseudo and new age imposters. They silence NAs who fight back against racists who are Black Supremists who wish to steal anything good that NAs contributed to the world. It’s getting out of hand and they are swarming Facebook and Instagram with false memes and misinformation. They also silence Pro-Palestinians and Palestinian people from telling the truth about the Nation State of Israel is committing genocide and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians in their own ancestral homelands as the indigenous peoples of those lands. They label freedom fighters as terrorists just like they did with Native Americans who were only protecting their lands, culture and people from genocidal settlers, invaders and squatters. This needs to stop! All indigenous people throughout the world need to fight against historical revisionism as a cover for minority rights. Blacks are not Indigenous to America, and Zionists are not indigenous to Palestine."
"The app is ok to deal with but the people you may know feature is completely annoying and frustrating. I must say it’s a nice feature but it gets frustrating when you remove people and the next day or a few days later they show up again as people you may know. Facebook needs to add a delete button for that and not just the remove button or the remove button should remove that person and their profile permanently because hitting the remove button only brings that person profile back up within a day or a few days. I’m completely irritated with it because if I hit the remove bottom it’s because I don’t know that person, I don’t want to know that person, or don’t want to be friends with that person. I shouldn’t have to spend so much time “removing” but not permanently removing people from the “people you may know” only for them to pop back up as people I may know 24-48hrs later!! IT’S ANNOYING. STOP IT FACEBOOK LET ME PERMANENTLY REMOVE PEOPLE I DON’T KNOW AND/OR DON’T WANT TO KNOW OR BE BOTHERED WITH WITHOUT HAVING THEM POP UP AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. REVAMP THE “PEOPLE YOU MAY KNOW” FEATURE SO THAT IT CAN BE BETTER MANAGED BY US!! Thanks 😤😤"
"Hello I deleted this app after ten years of using it . I had a lot of fun in the beginning when you could build private groups and post anything . That was before the nudity and violence algorithms took over . I miss the r.i.p. groups . I said ok let’s get serious , I administered several groups with tens of thousands of members and we started getting pressured about hunting photos showing guns and hunted animals . I fought to keep them posted in the group for years . Hunting is a way of life for most people who live outside a city . I gave up after a few years and completely sterilized my profile , deleted all my friends and left all the groups , I only followed pages after that and used market place and messenger . During the capital riots I was immediately put on a 24 hour ban because a person reported me for bullying because I disagreed with them . I tried to get a review and they still wouldn’t lift it .  It was time to fully leave the app , it used to be fun to joke and carry on but these last four years has been horrible . I will be fine and maybe this app will return to being fun and people can be ok being themselves again ."
"Facebook used to be a great place to reconnect with old friends, make new friends and keep in touch with relatives. Now, everything has changed! 1. I am unable to share my personal opinions and I am unable to share news articles or information from what many view as reliable sources, without being “fact checked”. What used to be great an incredible app, has now become nothing but political bias and censorship. 2. I’ll have a private conversation with someone in my home, go on FB at a later time and suddenly there are adds for things I was talking about. Why are you listening to my conversations offline??? 3. You can’t belong to a private group that discusses opinions and share information that may or may not be actual facts and the group gets shut down. Why does FB get to decide what the topics are in a private groups of likeminded people and just shut it down because they do not agree??? 4. They get to decide what facts are, but it’s ok for people to verbally abuse those with differing views. That doesn’t get strikes, suspensions or bans. 5. Who are these fact checkers and who fact checking them!!! What was once an enjoyable app for all, is now unusable and unwanted!!!"
"Facebook could be good but it lacks a lot of necessary things such as if.....
The “Help Center” offered assistance from an actual person. With Covid-19 people are doing tons of scamming and I’m unfortunately a victim of it. My page password was changed and my personal email was compromised. Of course you know you need those things to regain your page. I went and made a comment in the “Community” comments and Facebook flag me and disabled me from their app saying it was irreversible. How does that make any sense when I’m coming to you guys for a solution? It’s frustrating because their final option to try and regain my page was simply.... Start a new page 😒!  I’ve had my page (15 years) since Facebook began (2004) not to mention a business page attached to it that I can no longer access. You can be a loyal user but they don’t care at all. That’s why you have 20 fake pages of the same person and they don’t care about that, but they were upset about my comment which wasn’t disrespectful, rude, no curse words, just asking for help to regain my page. How disappointing Facebook. I guess I’ll just make an Instagram because starting over is absolutely INSANE! 👎🏾"
"I know that writing a review is pointless because, for years I’ve watched Facebook members complain about the same problems, over and over but, Facebook doesn’t listen. Facebook does it their way regardless of what its members request. The only reason Facebook has this review section is because Apple requires it. Facebook has never listened to its members, and never will. This app continues to be the most unreliable, complicated, cluttered mess I’ve ever seen. The news feed shows what Facebook wants you to see, instead of what your friends post, in the order it was posted. There are so many irrelevant advertisements on your timeline and you can’t even watch any videos without Facebook forcing you to watch another irrelevant commercial they’ve inserted into the video. Also, this is the most invasive app in the App Store. Facebook mines your personal information 24/7. The app uploads the contacts from your phone without you knowing and shares the information with everyone. Now, pictures won’t load properly, after the last useless update. **there are many more problems with this horrible app but, I’m out of time. I’ll be back to write more later**"
"So I updated my Facebook app to the latest version and for some reason Facebook dating isn’t showing up at all. It’s now been 3 weeks that this has been going on for me and I’m sure other people are having the same issues. When you go to the 3 bars on the Facebook app usually the dating button is there but it hasn’t been there for 3 weeks now. Saying it’s unavailable. I had a profile on there and all of a sudden my profile and the dating button just disappeared and is not showing up. I have done every tutorial I have come across and I have reset my phone, turned it off dozens of times, I’ve deleted the Facebook app multiple times and reinstalled Facebook app and still nothing. Today I just did another update on Facebook app and still no dating app, so what is going on and when is Facebook going to fix this issues that has been clearly going on for many people for weeks or probably months for some. Someone at Facebook needs to say something to the people or fix the issue as soon as possible. This is going on for too long and shouldn’t be going on any longer. Fix the issues Facebook!!!!"
"When I updated last time, the orders of how the comments or messages show up are all weird.  It shows up as “most relevant” first and in no particular order.  And even when I change to “newest first”, it still shows the “most relevant” first.  I cannot rearrange the messages to show up in order of oldest to newest or vice versa.  Please fix this! 

I updated the app hoping this will help the problem above.  But with this new update, not only the problem above persist, I now have a new problem.  When uploading pictures, I can no longer have the option to look up my pictures in the albums/folders I created.  I can only look through the camera rolls, where things are in no particular order.  I belong to buy and sell groups and sell things on Facebook.  So I created these albums/folders to increase efficiency when looking for items to post to save my sanity and not have to look through thousands of pictures in the camera rolls.  Now there is no options to go to the albums/folders.  Please fix this ASAP or your app will becomes useless soon. Please help us becomes more efficient, not less.  So frustrated!!!"
"Here recently videos have started displaying this keep watching button right in the middle of the video. If I’m just scrolling through my newsfeed and want to watch a video in it’s entirety then I should be able to do that!! Not only that but then I also have to deal with the ads in the video too! It’s frustrating and makes the app not very enjoyable to use! Also, the back/forward arrows on a webpage need to be put back where they were at the bottom of the page. It’s too easy now to hit the X button to close a webpage when all I really wanted to do was go back a page. Very frustrating when you’ve been looking at something for a long time only for it to close and then the newsfeed refreshes and you’ve lost the link you were looking at originally. None of the other apps (Pinterest, Instagram) do this. Their back/forward buttons are at the bottom of the screen, away from the “X” button so you don’t risk closing your page. It’s little thing like this that make or break an app. And right now Facebook, you’re on the verge of falling apart."
"I’ve had my account since 2016. Never once did I have any issues reporting people back then. I’m now 21 years old. I legit had a 16 year old dude try to sleep with me not only that try to convince me to send him nudes when I told him NO. That’s absolutely disgusting and not okay. So I decided to post him on my towns local site as a warning to make sure everyone knows not to mess with this dude because he is trouble and trying to get others in trouble. My account got BANNED for 30 days because I exposed him!!!! I was told by Facebook it was bullying??? How is exposing some 16 year old creep, bullying?? I tried to fight this case at the Oversight Board but they denied it as well to even give me my Facebook back sooner. Be careful when on this site. Facebook doesn’t care about its users nor care about safety. You will also see lots of scammer posts and there is NO category to even report them in. Facebook WILL NOT take them down! Kiss this app goodbye if youve been using it for years. You’re better off going to MEWE, an alternative of Facebook. You get freedom of speech there and even the right to report the ACTUAL stuff that should be taken down along with another person."
They are so ridiculous now. Facebook is the devil. You can’t even joke with your friends on there saying harmless things. 30 days Facebook jail…over two friends joking back and forth on a private page. The censorship is unreal! I shared something on Facebook and again 30 days in Facebook jail! You can’t bring up anything. There use to be such a thing as free speech and ppl could debate…now you either tow the line or you get restricted every direction you turn! So wrong! They allow posts and groups about loving lil boys and sick things like that! That doesn’t go against community standards! But man joke with your friend and say you’ll come sock them if they don’t go to the ER to get metal out of their eye and BAM you’re inciting violence and go against community standards! So wrong! Can’t speak out about being against the Vaxx…I don’t care who gets it I don’t care who don’t it’s a personal choice but do not even say you will not be getting it! What a joke! I don’t care any more if I’m banned for life! All they’ve done is open ppls eyes to what’s going on in the world by pushing ppl to other platforms that don’t censor! So bravo Facebook! Thank you for helping in awakening the masses!
"Facebook has grown stronger in censoring what you say. They pick and choose what news is worth offering, that you share on your page! You have zero rights and freedoms to what you post! They will shut down your account and refuse an appeal, if you post things that goes against their agenda. I had my page shut down beginning of this year, and couldn’t obtain years worth of videos or pictures! So definitely don’t post pictures without saving to our own device first. If you care about modern events in today’s times, they will be censored, or even be sent to Facebook jail between 7-30 days! As we enter this preface of the World Wide Web, remember there are no rights or true freedom to what you post here! If there is a major event in your town, and you post your opinion, the fact checkers can call the police and send them to your location, via their app location tracker. It sounds far fetched, but this has happened in Hunt/Kaufman County I. Texas, and a man was arrested for an opinionated post over a huge event that was currently taking place. This app needs to NOT be used by children, teenagers, and even adults should tread lightly."
"Here we are years later and the same issues still persist with Facebook. It is hard to keep up with the updates. It seems as soon as I get one update installed there is another waiting the next day. It wouldn’t be so bad but they can’t be downloaded unless connected to a WiFi network, no cellular data can be used. I don’t have an issue with storage because i purchased more iCloud storage years ago. But I can see this being a problem for many people especially if they use Facebook and messenger as they are large downloads. Hence the reason you have to be connected to a WiFi network to download. Not to mention, when these updates are pushed through every two weeks, most of the bugs aren’t being squashed. So what exactly are these updates for? It’s becoming more of a pain than pleasure or fun networking. Seems like every time there is an update the last two months, the functionally gets worse and worse. They think they've fixed one issue yet 5 more take its place. I'm just done at this point. I'll stay connected with my phone just fine without Facebook. See ya Zuck"
"Censorship overload, so sickening. I have been in Facebook jail over and over for 30 day periods.
My most recent jail and at present time now is this. I am part of a breast cancer private support group. Within the group a gal was going to get reconstruction surgery and was confused on what procedure she should get. She asked us all to show before and after of our reconstruction surgeries and what procedure we got and doctors we used. I put pasties over mine and posted after I saw others posting their full breasts. One second and bam I was banned for sexual content. 30 days 😡 The admin said all others are still on and mine got banned. She tried contacting FB with no help. 
With the presidential election, it was so biased, it was sickening. I reported someone’s post with a real penis out of Trumps face and Facebook said it didn’t go against Facebook standards but my post with Harris skinned knees, I  got banned and I got jail again. Wake up Facebook, everyone is leaving and going to another social media network. 
I have complained multiple times about issues that my timeline highlights things that I already looked at, but nobody fixes it. 😡SO OVER YOU FACEBOOK!"
"They flagged my account and threatened to suspend me stating I was a “dangerous individual or group” for posting a meme of Biden as the Quaker Oats guy and it says “Faker Votes”. If that’s not a violation of simple fun being poked then it’s an outright gag-rag stuffed down my throat for exposing REAL WORLD criminal acts of deception towards and entire nation. Bye Facebook, don’t worry about trying to come back from THIS. It’s your pink-slip, walking papers, eviction notice. Your bankruptcy will be closely following after what you have done to your user base. Siding with traitors and treasonous cheating commies!

Facebook is pretty much done and over with. I don’t even know how they ever beat out MySpace. At least that site wasn’t a total useless piece of trash like Facebook has ALWAYS been.
Now they’re censoring everything their users do, post and say. I don’t know about you, but for me, that’s not social media. It’s socialist media and that’s all this app links to.
There are much better options available now and I wouldn’t even waste my time giving these jerks your personal details and information. They hold onto it like Gold to sell later on the black market. Like MySpace did when THEY went bankrupt."
"I have had an account with Facebook for at least 13 years. These last 4 years I have noticed that Facebook has increasingly become biased and started silencing people’s opinions that differ from facebooks own agenda. If you like to be treated like a child that is incapable of making their own choices, then this is the app for you. This is the app of Censorship, “fact-checking” your personal opinions, account suspension if you think differently than them, and threats of deleting your account. 
The year of 2020 has been stressful enough without having my social media shoving their personal agenda down my throat. If you don’t have Facebook yet and are considering it, I highly recommend that you watch the documentary “the social dilemma” on Netflix first, before making your decision. When this type of social media has caused the increase of suicide in kids 10-14 by 150%, there is something seriously wrong! 
Facebook took what could have been a great venue to connect people all across the world, and turned it into nothing more than a political circus used to push biased political information and further divide us. 
If I could give them a 0, I would!!!"
"I can write about the many issues with this platform, but I will speak about the 2 most important ones - FREEDOM of  Speech and Decency. In the first 8 mo of 2021 I was suspended 6 times for 30 days each for posting links from sites like Business Insider, Yahoo, etc. and 2 of these times the suspension was for the same old posts I already was suspended for... There is no way you get anyone to communicate with you so you can argue your case, despite the facade of ""giving you options"". I am an admin  a community group and was unable to communicate with its members just because I had suspension on my other group! Any info on the pandemic, vaccine reports, even herb natural treatments gets you suspended, any video or meme gets blacked out with a banner, cannot believe this is an American company set in CA, with all the freedoms laid in the US constitution and 1A! In the mean time, Zuck has spent tens of $millions helping destroy our election system...and WHILE half naked busty girls photos in provocative and suggestive poses are all over everyone's feed, even children's feed; cats galore and degrading videos flourish on FB. Either this must stop now, or the last sane people will leave this app."
"We run our small business through Facebook and most of the experience is not the best. Sometimes while going lives to our customers, random people will jump in and start spamming words in the chat box. When I when to remove them from the live, we get “we are sorry but an error has occurred. Please try again later”. The person staying in the live and trashed the whole sales which lasted hours. Another one is that our page was banned from being able to message our customers as we were labeled as “spam” while all we were trying to do is notify everyone about our live sale. Why are you controlling when we can or cannot message OUR CUSTOMERS. Give that person the ability to unsubscribe if they don’t like it. But, to ban us entirely is out of control!!!! But to make it better, we get a message from Facebook saying we could “ask for forgiveness” and they might reconsider. When I try to load that page, I get “an error as occurred” and I tried to load that page everyday for a week. Never changed and got the same message every time. And I use an iPhone 11pro max so I know it’s not my phone………."
"Where to start…

Facebook used to be pretty great for staying in touch with people, but it’s been turned into a tool to censor dissident opinions and prompt the worst of groupthink I’ve ever seen in my life. It’s hilarious how Facebook seems to have turned into the fictitious Ministry of Truth from Orwell’s 1984. Truth no longer matters as long as it doesn’t fit facebooks preferred political bias. I was under the impression that fascism was a right wing ideology, but clearly that’s not the truth as Facebook is notoriously left leaning and is taking notes straight from the fascist’s playbook. The hilarity of it all is overshadowed by the sinister nature of the app and the way the so called “community standards” are set up. Facebook could care less about free speech if that speech opposes their own views and bias. Reading the reviews, it’s become apparent that this is a very large issue that is affecting very many people around the world. A place that once used to promote open discussion has not turned into an echo chamber of groupthink. I guess if Facebook wants to shout themselves in the foot and destroy their social network that they created, they’re free to do so and they’re incredibly competent at doing just that!"
"I use to have a lot of fun on Facebook. I was, and still is, involved in many group pages and I love to comment and have great conversations with people. But recently, Facebook has put a damper on this. Now it seems like everyday I have “reached my limit of comments”. It makes it frustrating for me and my groups as well. Since when did they start making comment limits? They don’t even tell you how many, it just randomly pops up. You can’t search for it or even prepare so you don’t pass the “limit” and when you do it one, the comments become less and less. It isn’t me spamming but genuinely sharing and connecting. I see so many spammers that continue to comment while people who aren’t get blocked. It makes me not want to use Facebook ever! I know I’m not the only one who feels this either! Also, you can’t even talk to anyone in IT. It’s either you disagree or not. But no matter what, it doesn’t make a difference. It takes the voice and community it tried to build back in the day and just make things worse! I’ve been apart of Facebook since 2014, and never once had I ever had issues or problems until this year."
"I am so sick of facebook. The app has been on a decline anyways throughout the past couple years and I have never been a total fan of it, but my doubts were strengthened recently when there was an issue with a page I am supposed to be an admin on, and facebook REFUSES to help me get the role back. I have sent countless complaints and even tried to complain through a copyright report just so I could contact someone. Even after reading my report, all I got back was an email from a worker that told me that I was not reporting any copyright issues and gave me links to their useless hep center that doesn’t provide any solutions for my issue. After researching online, I saw that many others have faced this issue and only a facebook employee can change it back. This would be fine if only I could contact them directly, which I unfortunately can’t because facebook decided to eliminate the customer service contact portion of their business model. So basically facebook are idiots, they have a bad business model, they are not for helping their customers, and they are on a downward slope to being a forgotten app that everyone got tired of."
"I don't know why but lately Facebook app has been shutting down and going to my main screen while I'm reading something😡very annoying!!! Fix this bug please! It also refreshes on its own. That's really annoying too when you are going through comments and then back out wanting to continue where you were before going to the comments and it decides on its own ""nope you were done scrolling"" 🙄 
Nothing has been fixed. It still does all of the above even tho there's been tons of updates. Seriously fix this issue it's annoying! Stars went down bc it still hasn't been fixed

STILL REFRESHES ON ITS OWN! When will this be fixed??? In the middle of reading something in Facebook and go to my internet for a second and then back to Facebook and it decides I was done and refreshes and sends me back to the top! Very annoying and j lose posts I was in the middle of reading. Why won’t you fix this issue. Many people have the same issue yet you don’t fix it!! Stars went down yet again bc it’s not fixed. One 1 star to go and honestly if I could give it a 0 star I would! Fix the freaking problem already!!!"
"My boyfriend has linked his pubg account to Facebook from the time pubg came out. He has invested time and money in the game. He has done nothing on his Facebook that violates Facebook violations. His account has been disabled for absolutely no reason and now he cannot assess ANYTHING he has linked with Facebook. This is unacceptable. I have done research and have seen that this has been going on for almost two years now with others around the world  and Facebook has done NOTHING about it. It is unfair that persons have lost their accounts so suddenly and are not getting the proper help they so deserve. You have persons that have been locked out of their accounts for months even after filling out the appeal. People that have had their accounts for more than 10 years are now being told that they are “underaged” and they cannot do anything about it. Waiting on customer service is absolutely ridiculous and unfair. And if we get a response, it is automatic and the information is useless. We need answers and people need to get their accounts back. This is not over and I will be contacting Facebook continuously until I receive a proper response."
"To start off, I haven’t been on Facebook in nearly two years now. I reloaded the app solely for marketplace while looking for a vehicle. I’m running the latest software & auto update apps on my iPhone 11 Pro. Amongst the more than often crashes I whiteness every couple minutes, the startup and loading speeds of this platform are ridiculously slow. Going back to the purpose of getting this app, when attempting to use the basic filters on here, they often don’t work under the vehicle section of marketplace. When I do get certain filters to work, they more than often lock out and I’m unable to remove them when I want to change to another filter. For instance, I started looking at used Tacoma’s and wranglers, I’ve had to delete the app and reload almost every time just to clear out my filter settings in the cars & trucks for sale page. For a company worth nearly $600 billion, you’d think they’d replace the interface which I noticed hasn’t seen hardly any changes w/ in the past couple years."
"I would really appreciate it if you could put hacking as one of the things your not allowed to do on Facebook because I reported these two groups who hack peoples groups and accounts for money and there was no hacking thing for me to report them for (it would be awesome if you could make it so we can give a personal report) so I reported them for doing sales that weren’t allowed and in the message back they just completely ignored the fact that the group was hacking, like what the heck?!?!? I mean no hate this is one of the best apps I own but those hacker groups might mess things up a bit one of the groups I’m in is doing some shutting down stuff as well as not letting new members join because of the hackers! It would be great if you could do something about it!! The group name is “black hat hackers” and actually when you look that up you find a few more hacking groups too please do something about it this really is not good thank you if you do!"
"In the latest update, the app no longer has the “share” button when you try to share a post to a group. You must individually look up and share each group, which is cumbersome and takes far more steps/time. My child is a brand Rep, and it used to be so convenient to make our promotion post and share in 5-10 groups with a few quick taps. Now, I have to individually share the post to each individual group. I understand it is probably some kind of safety feature to prevent hackers and bots and bugs, but it has really made it more difficult for us. 

Also, the new layout on the computer (not the app, but the physical website) has me all sorts of lost and confused. I’m a pretty tech-y person, but when you move everything from its relative location, it makes it much more difficult of an interface to use. 

Love the new avatars though!!! They are super fun and cute!!! Also, the new and updates privacy settings on groups are lovely!"
"They’re run almost completely by bots it seems and you can be banned from posting for the most ridiculous things. Wasn’t like this before, but either they’re under new management or their bots are now hypersensitive. I didn’t even get told what I did wrong, only that I posted something offensive in one of the many groups I’m in (I’m in a group for people to share offensive opinions, so yeah I’m going to post something there that may be construed that way because that is what that group is for!) and that I’m blocked from posting until April 1. April 1 came and I tested it out, still blocked until 8:22 the morning they said. It’s 8:58 now and I’m still blocked, but no explanation this time. I’ve had posts taken down before that don’t break any laws or advocate breaking any laws, but are simply funny memes that I share to specific groups so I don’t offend anyone who is outside of that group and not wanting to see it. Even been banned just for posting my opinions, no threats, no attacking people, just operating my right to freedom of speech! They shouldn’t call themselves a public platform if they can’t uphold the rights of the public."
"The app has been driving me crazy for months now. If I stay on the Facebook page, it only blacks out once or twice per evening. If I want to read something (my cousin's newspaper article, for instance) posted by my friends, the app blacks out every time and if I want to continue on Facebook, I have to open the app all over again and hope I can find my place. I'm almost ready to delete the darn thing!  Wondering if it's worth the frustration! I've written my problems to the staff through Facebook three times and have received no recommendations. Can the app be fixed?

Well, it's about 2 ,months later and nothing has improved. The  app still freezes and blacks out. If I try to move from a post to attached info it freezes.  Moving down the page to more posts makes it freeze or it blacks out completely. Then I get to start all over opening the app yet again. This is really getting to be more trouble than it's worth. It would be nice if the it people would at least respond in some way. A lot of us are feeling ignored. Not good business practice!"
"When using browser all appears fine. 
However, once i downloaded the app, I found 1000’s upon 1000’s of complaints and reports to Facebook , after I got an alert on the app that I had been tagged by someone I did not know. All of these 1000’s of people do not know who the individual(s) actually are they are using an account with a name that is highly unlikely is the person doing it, They are accessing peoples photos, including photos of peoples Children which brings a high risk concern that the Individual(s) could be using the pics to target our children for abduction and human trafficking, they are hacking and gaining peoples locations, device and network access, changing settings, stealing intellectual property, harassing people - Taunting them openly, while committing innumerable illegal activities. 
I did a search, thousands more complaints, you cannot block the Individual(s) or remove them, I did a search and Found that someone has created a webpage domain with my name on it, saying it’s being constructed, the claimed company who creates webpages is listed as Afrihost based out of Africa. This needs to be addressed by Apple and Facebook with a High sense of urgency."
"Facebook, once upon a time you were amazing, truly incredible. You set out to connect people to each other. There was a time of peace and harmony on your platform. We shared our adventures, families, and, for a while, far too many food pictures. We connected with distant family members, international friends, and long lost school mates. You helped give us a voice in our communities and inner circles. You helped us laugh and not feel so alone. However, somewhere along the way, you sold us out. Maybe it was with good intentions, but you changed. You started to pick the things you thought we wanted to see or what you thought we ought to see. You assigned point values into the algorithms to help us see the important happenings, but sadly it lended to click bait, heated arguments, and broken friendships. And to top it off, there are so many ads, I’m hard pressed to find any meaningful content that I signed up for from the beginning. Facebook, you ruined something that was beautiful. I would have gladly paid a subscription fee if you were able to offer what you were 10 years ago. But alas, who would choose you now? Not me. Farewell."
"I have been with fb for over 10 years, Started in 2008… Anyway, you alls app, not sure about the website(quit using it) anyway I have had a horrible time with going on pages that I have to ask something to a person, or I just want to like and follow them… But, about 6 months ago, and just today, I have had to delete the whole app, because, I could get off the page to get back to the main feed, there is a bunch of other issues.. One, comes to mind, my family and I lost a beloved pet 8 years  ago, and you blocked this said post because you people said it was inappropriate, I mean really, it was a dog picture, my family doesn’t do inappropriate thing or even say them, let alone post anything…. If this keeps up, and you people don’t fixe all of the complaints that I and my family… And whatever ones that I can’t think of right now, then I will have no choice to get rid of my whole account,  and having it since 2008, would be hard for someone to get rid of it… But, it will happen if things don’t improve for me and my family… So annoyed, thinking about going to another social media app🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄"
"Whomever told you this latest update was a great idea, SHOULD BE FIRED. 1)When notifications come in that I’ve been tagged or someone has replied to a comment I made, it no longer takes you to the post, just to the comment. So if I commented last week and I get a reply today I have absolutely no idea what the original post was about. 2) A notification disappears after I look at it. So if I have to refer back to it for any reason, I have to somehow find the page of the original poster and then hunt for the post. STUPID IDEA 3) When going to some notifications, when you click on it it takes you to a blank post. I see the persons name, the time they posted and maybe if someone reacted to it, but absolutely no post at all. There’s even comments on it but I see no post at all. Yes I have access to  their page, I haven’t been blocked and they call me to say “did you see my last post” and all I see is nothing. 
3) Auto refresh is annoying. Someone posts an article and I take 2-3 minutes reading it and when I go to comment on it, you’ve refreshed my feed. Thanks for nothing. 
I’m sick of y’all. If I didn’t need this app to keep in contact with family around the globe, I’d delete it."
"Facebook has used its power to push democratic ideology while actively censoring any opposing viewpoints, they are clearly biased and believe that people do not have the ability to choose for themselves what they think is true and correct by eliminating certain ideas that go against their agenda. They use money gained from selling our personal information to advertisers and have no regard for privacy, going so far as to use our microphones and cameras to get any information they can to profit from us. They do not believe in the first amendment and hide behind the fact that they are a private company that has the right to choose what content they want on their platform even though they know full well that they have moved beyond the realm of private company and are now more of a public service/accommodation. They have monopolized the market along with Twitter and actively work with other big tech companies to eliminate or buy out any competition leaving hardly any other alternatives for social media. This is a complete technocracy that encourages Democrat misinformation while censoring truth with their bought and paid for ""fact checkers""."
"When I first joined Facebook way back in its earlier days, I enjoyed connecting with and communicating with family and friends, playing games, sharing photos and joining some special interest groups. After awhile I found it to be a bit too invasive and left. Years later I rejoined again for family reasons. I began to use it for national and international news and political interest as well. Over the years, and especially during this election year, Facebook became increasingly biased against conservative views. The “fact checkers,” engineers and executives seem to work overtime to censor important conservative news and information, to stifle free speech and exchange of information and discourse, and to often shut down members who do not tow some of the leftist political lines, talking points and agendas. I now feel like it is becoming a literal arm of the globalist/socialist/leftist juggernaut which is intent on introducing a controlling groupthink mentality on the world. What was once an entertaining and educational forum has become very partisan, very controlling and even divisive. I’ve stayed mainly because of special interest groups in arts, health/medicine and many other."
"Hi there! So I’m addicted to the FaceFeed as anyone else, and I’ve a couple of suggestions for the iOS/iPadOS app. Currently using FaceBook in the Safari browser is better for me because of keyboard support. It seems crazy to me that there isn’t at least support for scrolling through the feed with arrow keys on Bluetooth or otherwise connected keyboards. Commands for search and home and refresh, etcetera, would be nice too- but man, the scrolling thing kills me. Also, I doubt I’ll see a change here as the way videos are currently presented seems designed to keep people watching them, but it feels awfully user-hostile to have to figure out different swipe patterns and do it quickly to dismiss a video before another one plays. Also, the relegating of Airplay options to that sub-menu alongside Chromecast options basically broke proper Airplay support. It never seems to want to stream to my AppleTV properly now, always have to give up and go with the less than ideal screen mirroring system-wide option. Cheers."
"You would think with the billions of dollars Facebook is rolling around in that they could put out a better product. The messenger/Facebook app split was a terrible decision, especially when they don't work well together. Marketplace is one of the most difficult to use and browse sites I have ever seen. Some items you can share, some you can't. Why? Who knows... Marketplace is also filled mostly with scams that ""ship"". It will always default to show items that ship and you can't turn off that ""feature"". Half of my listings are of an online company called Vroom. These listings exist even when ""local"" is selected. It is also impossible to hide or block ads from this user. I am assuming they put a lot of money into Facebook's pockets. Need technical support? Good for you, Facebook doesn't hire customer support and instead relies on their idiot customers. This app and company are cancer and just need to die already. Not one decision they make is for the end user. Update: Issues still persist Update 2: still trash; now Facebook keeps telling me I have new messenger messages, open messenger app and no new messages. Get it together ""Meta""..."
It is completely a waste of time it is unfair you get in trouble all the time for no reason when it’s not your fault I’ve recently been in trouble three times for absolutely no reason third time I have to wait up to seven days to use Messenger again I’m on day four I have contacted and report a problem multiple times multiple different ways between my iPhone and laptop nothing has worked I’m about to completely delete and uninstall Facebook from both devices they in French on your freedom of speech by censoring what you say they spy on you like crazy I have information leading all the way back to when I first downloaded the app and everything up until now which Hass to be some form of stocking it’s just not worth it I don’t recommend downloading Facebook at all and I’ve talk to my friends about deleting it because it’s creepy and a waste of time and when you try to talk to get information on how to talk to people on Facebook there is no information is completely useless even when you report a problem it doesn’t work the app is not worth it and this is the most worthless horrible app I’ve ever seen
"I feel as though this is necessary. It keeps saying “your account is restricted” and no I’m not banned from posting outside of groups.  For some reason I just can’t join groups and when I get invited to them I’m allowed to join but I can’t post anything. Also, Facebook keeps resetting itself to light theme when I prefer dark theme. This happens once every couple of days. Not to mention the big tech censorship. I stumbled upon a post from trump, and someone made a point that was so absurdly stupid that I just had to respond (I’m independent) he called trump names like an incompetent blob, but when I responded by using his point against him and calling him a mamook, I got a 30 DAY POST BAN! A WHOLE MONTH! Yet whenever someone calls the president names it’s completely fine. Mark Zuckerberg if you see this, the only reason I still use this sorry excuse of an app is because there’s family that I connect with on here that I don’t have that option anywhere else. Fix the restriction, fix the theme fixing bug, and stop censoring people’s opinions that differ from you. We have freedom of speech for a reason and you’re violating that!"
I constantly have issues with the Facebook app with it freezing up and not responding to things I touch. Sometimes I’ll be scrolling through and the whole app will turn gray and lock up which forces me to close the app wait a second and then reopen it. The app in general just seems laggy and not as smooth as it could be. I also have several issues cropping issues. Posts being to far to the right or left so you can’t read the whole post etc. marketplace is also very glitchy crashes a lot whenever I am trying to post a listing. I have the iPhone 13 pro only a few months old so I shouldn’t be having any issues like this. Facebook also seems to drain my battery really bad. I feel like Facebook eats up more power than other apps I use about the same amount of time. Obviously there’s lots of factors to battery life but being the glitches and lag I’m experiencing I’m guessing this app isn’t as optimized as it should be which is sad for a company as big as meta they should be able to hire plenty of developers to make a smooth running efficient app
"Use Facebook for several years both personally and professionally. I managed a paged for a charitable foundation as well. I purchased ads at times to generate more views of posts. Last week I was hacked. I received a notification that my account was disabled. I went through the process of verifying who I was, which included scanning my ID. I received an email from Facebook that said they verified my ID and I should be able to login. I went through two step authentication, and when they wanted to do a security check there was an error. While doing that my bank was billed $50 by Facebook, because whoever hacked me used my Facebook ad account to buy ads for their fraudulent posts. I contested, but since the bank says the ads are auto-billed, there is nothing they can do. Facebook and no customer service. Emails do not get answered. I have filled out their form to report a problem multiple times. Nothing. Still locked out. I talked with others who went through the same thing. They had to build a new account. This is crap. For one of the biggest, most powerful companies, they sure have crappy service."
"I’ve been a loyal Facebook member for over a decade. For the first time ever, one of my comments get blocked, when it was a simple expression of support for my family in Palestine. I criticized Israel and wrote very specifically that my criticism is not against Jews or Judaism, but the acts of the Zionists in my land. The bias demonstrated by Facebook and the double standards in allowing some to express their view points but not others was disgusting. There is nothing worse than injustice. Since when does Facebook control free speech. My comment and posts were not hate speech, they were not anti-Semitic, they were not rude, cruel, or vulgar. They were my position supporting Palestine and Palestinians against the war machine of Israel. I was and still am against the inhumane use of indiscriminate and non-proportional use of force against the civilian population in Gaza. Who are you to dictate what my opinion is. Where were you when we witnessed people using your stage to spread lies and fake news and you defended their right of speech. Don’t talk to me about algorithms as if to scare me with big words. I have a PhD in ChemE and lead a 100+ group of data scientists. Enough is enough."
"For the last 2 months, the notification settings in the app are a complete mess.  The app will have the red number, but one of them are about my own posts. Any reactions or comments to MY posts don’t load in the list of notifications, so I have no idea about comments or reactions unless I actually go to the post itself.  All I see are notifications about my friends’ posts.  Further, while the news feed works fine, the list of notifications is limited to EXACTLY 20 notifications.  When I scroll to the bottom, the page just jumps and doesn’t refresh to show any more than exactly 20.  Maybe once a week I will scroll and be surprised to be able to scroll past 20, but it’s not because of anything I did or didn’t do.  AND once I scroll back to the top of the list and scroll back down, I’m limited to 20 again.   AND notifications for my posts still aren’t in the list.  I have a brand new iPhone 6s Plus (3 months), so if Facebook doesn’t fix it soon, I am going to be convinced that the problems are a way to push people to upgrade their phones to the newest versions."
I can’t remember when I liked Facebook in a LONG TIME! When they decided to to play Judge and jury over what games we were playing ( which included many many Facebook people who wanted to take over Facebook with selfish selfies and Hey Look at me so called bible authorities which included nothing nothing I ever read in the Bible??? Why? Bc it was new age Christian or whatever that wiped all their sins away and still let them let them cast stone’s at others with sin to people who they didn’t like anymore! Hypocrite Bible studies and  Fake selfies pushed all of the fun and and entertaining that people used to enjoy! Plus I cannot see all of my friends that I follow or all of my favorite entertainment that I like and follow! I get 2 or 3 friends that I follow and 1 entertainment ( Steve Harvey) to be exact that I follow! I can’t even share my children’s pictures bc they say it’s in my settings! I follow Facebook instructions and it NEVER works! Nothing in my Facebook settings ever works and I do have the Facebook app also ! I recently just stopped using Facebook at all bc of all of the troubles I have had and now I can rest more easily! Thanks Fakebook !
"Nobody wants a game page or a group page. It’s amazing how many different ways you want to send me push notifications, that I literally only click on so that it will go away. I went in to change my notification settings and it turns out you will not let me turn off all group notifications at once and I have to go through a list and manually select out of 100 groups which ones I want, the slider for all is greyed out. This is totally unnecessary, and nobody asked for this. Why do I have a notification for every time someone goes live? Anytime an event is added at a venue I checked into ONE TIME that’s across the world in a different country? Facebook notifications used to notify me when someone wanted to talk to me, and I’ve done my best to continually update my setting but it’s getting crazy. Now I’ll have 7 notifications and check it and not a single one is about a friend I have that was reaching out to me. Events, game page, so and so went live, so and so checked in safe, I have memories from 10 years ago to look at, so and so posted in this group, like I do. Not. Care. And I don’t need a red push notification making it seem like I should."
"I’m a sole believer that nothing is perfect and this App is a great example of that.  The notification list jumps all over the place especially after tapping on a notification and it’s a video.  I don’t watch many of the videos but just by tapping on it and going back to the list the notification get scrambled and then they’ll be on from 5 minutes (example times) then the next one will be from a day ago or more.  And some that I’ve already tapped on like I actually looked at it are mixed in with some that I haven’t.  I could go on and on but I’m hoping you get the point because there’s way too much wrong and I don’t feel like typing it all.  Facebook just needs a complete makeover.  Only reason I keep it is so I can see my extended family’s post that live in the UK.  But even those are messed up and sometimes don’t see the for days after they were posted.  Now I know why Facebook doesn’t have a customer support number we can call because it would be ringing off the hook and wait times would be crazy.  Fix, fix and yup you guessed it fix."
"FACEBOOK i have been completely locked out of my account. I sent my GOVERNMENT ID and now it never even sent me a confirmation about this account. All my friends are on it and I do not have any of their contacts on other platforms. I need to get back into that account. My underage pictures are in it and its PUBLIC!!! All that happened was that I removed my old phone number that I was not using anymore. And then suddenly u guys asked for ID. NOW YOU IDIOTS WONT EVEN LET ME IN! PLEASE FIX THIS AND HELP ME GET BACK INTO MY ACCOUNT!!! You guys are frauds for taking my ID and promising to let me back in. 

Guys dont download facebook. If you have an account then download all your data and delete your account before you are asked to send ID for confirming your identity. They never respond. They are just using that to steal your information and track you. Then they will not let you into your account so that means you have to make a new account. This means they have more money by selling your old account information. Facebook used to be good and now its literally a piece of s* Go on twitter and instagram. Those are wayy better than facebook. Just remember to delete your account."
"Not only do you have to worry about scammers trying to get your money. But now you have to worry about the biggest scammer of them all, MARKETPLACE. I suggest ALL users to not make any type of money transactions on Facebook marketplace. Facebook has unexplainably taken many dollars out of multiple online sales I have made. And every time I report an issue to Facebook. I do not get a reply for over 2 weeks. By the time I get a reply on the issue they don’t seem to comprehend what my real issue is because they try to divert it into being a different type of issue with no real explanation. Even with the single photograph evidence your allowed to upload onto the troubleshoot report I get no real answer nor solution. Facebook customer service seems to be ran by automated robots to solve your problems that they have never encountered before. I suggest using other forms for payments if your going to make online transactions using Facebook market.
I will certainly never be making any type of online transactions here without knowing my money is actually coming to ME"
"This app is used every day by millions, if not billions of people everyday to include myself. I am a veteran of the US Military who joined because I believed that the USA was the best country in the world and because I wanted to protect not only my family but your family too. Even though we may not believe the same things and may have different views on things such as religion, politics, war, etc., that didn’t matter to me and it still doesn’t. I do not care about your views. I will listen to them and respect them and even in some circumstances I will debate but only if asked and then agree to disagree before the conversation turns hostile. This app does not care about freedom of speech and will censor anyone who it’s creator disagrees with. There is no room anymore for discussions on this app and there never will be again. I know that this review will not stop anyone from using the app and it probably won’t stop myself either as my entire family and all of my friends use this app. My problems with the app stem from bigger issues in the world and this app just so happens to allow those issues within its content."
First of all they are now rearranging comments taking them out of chronological order and making serious conversations look completely bizarre and hard to follow and so in a sense slandering those engaged in the conversation. I’ve also had a couple videos censored. After reading the explanation for why they censored it there was an obviously bias perspective that did not address everything as a whole. They twisted what the video was saying with their perspective and not verbatim. Grown adults should be able to use their own discretion as to whether or not something is touching on the truth without having another stranger who obviously is going to have an opinion & bias of their own interject. I’m also not very fond of how they’ve grown so big that they’re taking it upon themselves to tap into personal conversations for marketing as well as how much they are involved in obtaining personal information other than what somebody blatantly gives them such as the “about” information the user fills out themselves. Until they simmer down and fix these serious things I am giving them one star
"I really liked facebook and it has been great for my farm business. i have had a regular profile since 2019 or so and i recently made a business page (in may of 2021) for my farm. it’s been great for connecting with potential buyers and getting my farm page out there. i had been able to see that i had notifications on the bottom of my screen (where you switch to home, pages, notifications, or menu) and click into page notifications. now, i can still see that i’m getting notifications for my page but after i click to see what they are, it never loads. i figured it was due to bad internet / bad service but after it didn’t load in several different places i honestly stopped trying. my other things on my page work but not the notifications. since it’s been so long i’m getting pretty mad. if this isn’t fixed soon, im but sure that i’ll continue using facebook for my business.
Thanks for coming to my rant -Natalie (farm page: Moore Family Farm)"
Sadly my account was hacked - a security breach in the hands of Facebook.  But who is the one that pays the price?  Me and many others.  I had been with Facebook for 15 years - documenting my children’s adventures and mine only to have it all stripped away with no help whatsoever from them.  I have tried contacting and following the steps to get my account back.  But all I got was not only my personal account disabled but my business accounts that I paid for on Facebook and Instagram disabled as well because they were linked.  They know I was hacked yet they took all of my accounts away.  And now the app won’t even work for my new account.  For one of the richest companies in the world they have the absolute worst customer service.  I am disappointed that I invested so much of my life into the site.  I have lost all of the memories of when my kids said something funny or did something for the first time - photos that I thought I would have forever.  Shame on you Facebook.  You really should step up and help us out.  We are not the bad guys.  We are the ones you have made millions off of.
"I am not able to log into my account on the FB app. I was in it on November 1st and it forced logged me out saying login session expired. I have been getting an error message saying an unexpected error occurred please try logging in again. It has been almost two weeks. I have deleted and reinstalled the app, reset my network, reset my phone, updated the app, updated my phone, etc. several times and nothing has worked. The only time I’m able to logon is through the browser but not on the actual app. I am not able to access messenger on my phone period because the app will not work. I have had my page for 13 years and do not want to start over. I googled the issue and saw hundreds of people have the same problem and some said it has been months. One guy said he couldn’t even log in on another phone. Another said he created a whole new page and then started getting the same error message for that page on the app as well. This leads me to believe the problem must be the app itself and not an actual FB problem. So, what I am supposed to do to get this corrected? Please help!"
"I’m giving Facebook a 1* review because it’s not the same app that it was when it first started (obviously) and has changed for the worst. Yes it fits the latest iOS updates, and is easy to get around, but the way Facebook chooses what is right and wrong is annoying. 

Example: I made a comment against someone harassing women and I got my account restricted for 3 days. Then when I went to go report the comment that I was responding to, Facebook was like “the comment you’re reporting doesn’t go against standards,” yet mine was tagged as bullying. The comment I responded to said: “all women should stay in the kitchen because they’re useless to the world” how is that not bullying/offensive Facebook?! Another example I reported a woman posting basically nudity on public pages (ABC news/ESPN/etc) and THAT WASNT TAKEN DOWN EITHER. 

Only reason why I still have this app is because it’s how I talk to distant relatives and keep up with them. (Some live outside America). Facebook needs to stop picking and choosing what they think is right and wrong. Do better Facebook, or like my headline says, you’ll be “a thing of the past”"
"Something must have been updated or changed because the app on my iPhone is completely useless now. Cant even have a conversation with someone in a larger setting because comments don’t show up in order. Switching to a different order only makes it worse. “Top comments” get sorted in the most inefficient way and your option to change that are two other useless options. Notifications have been broken for over a month. Good luck trying to turn on notifications on a certain post, it literally does nothing. Doesn’t tell you if someone replied or tagged you. Not to mention everything on my main news feed is from 2-3 days ago!! News, family posts, videos...everything. The point of using this app daily is to keep up with current events. Not things that happened last week. I shouldn’t have to sort and rearrange the set up every single time I go on just to see new posts. For a company that makes billions, you’d think you be able to run an efficient app...or at least fix problems as the happen."
"I recently bought an Oculus Quest 2 to try and play VR games on PC, so I installed the Oculus app on the desktop & it said that it required a Facebook account. So I’m like okay let me create an account on Facebook so I can start playing. I created one on my phone then tried to log in to Facebook on PC but I forgot the password like 2 times & now it’s making me verify my account. I’m like okay...then it tells me to verify using E-mail. I clicked the E-mail that was associated with that account and EVERY TIME I try to get a verification for my E-Mail it says there’s an error, never sends the verification and says to retry later. 2 days later I’m still trying to log in and the same thing shows up. And from what I’ve saw there’s no way to contact Facebook about this issue. So basically I bought the Oculus Quest 2 for no reason cause I can’t even log in when that’s the only possible way of being able to connect it to your PC. This is kind of sad when all I’m trying to do is enjoy my Oculus for PC gaming but I can’t cause Facebook decides to not work for me. Please fix this soon, it’s making me more impatient as each day passes. ☹️"
Used Facebook for my business never posted anything bad hardly ever used it until I launched my business and page. Shortly after doing so my account ya been locked starting on June 9th. Every time I log in I’m told to finish securing my account with only the option to send a picture of my ID which I did on the 9th and here it is the 29th I’ve sent in way to many pictures of my ID. I am allowed to change my password but still unable to log in I get updates via email all the time about how my page is doing. I can’t respond to new customers my business has been at a halt literally a day after launch. If someone would actually open my account or take the time to respond I would gladly rate higher. But for a Major app to have no phone support and no email support or a live chat is sad. They don’t care enough to help or respond in any way. Just want back into my account. Never had this much of an issue with any app ever. What makes it worst is I use Instagram but can’t even market and promote on there as I need to be connected to a Facebook. I would be amazed if I actually got a response. Poor poor service.
"I never write reviews, but these recent updates make me want to delete Facebook. 6 months ago, if I needed to pause my Facebook scrolling go do something else, I would just click someone’s picture and it would “hold my place” in my newsfeed. This was great. I’m a mom to a toddler and I oftentimes have to multitask. NOW, if I switch to a different app or put my phone down for 10 SECONDS to do something else, my newsfeed refreshes, and starts at the top. This is infuriating when I’m in the middle of reading an article or looking at an album of pictures. What is the purpose of this? Who is it benefitting? Certainly not your users. I find myself getting on Facebook less and less these past few weeks because I get more annoyance than enjoyment out of it. Do you not do any kind of market research before you implement these things? And please, get rid of the camera. Everyone and their brother has a camera on their phone. I think we’re set! I’m tired of swiping left to exit a post and accidentally hitting the camera which takes 10 seconds to load.  I can’t imagine what your UI/QA teams get paid to “ok” these poorly planned “enhancements”."
"Not only is Facebook and complete joke when it comes to censorship - spewing lies and propaganda that fits to a liberal-minded agenda ONLY and blocking or banning anybody who doesn’t agree with their beliefs, but I have personally been tagged for inappropriate content or going against community standards numerous times for things that didn’t even make sense. Examples being my husband reading my children a bedtime story, apparent “hate speech” over making a joke about little boys being gross (I am a mother of 4 boys - I assure you they are gross (😂) and very well-loved), and the most recent made a comment to another person saying “it’s fun to just monkey with it” when talking about a Cricuit machine. I got tagged for bullying and harassment and was told my business group would be disbanded if I continued breaking community standards. When you try to contact them to figure out the reasoning, you just get bots and pre-written explanations and responses. The only reason I even use Facebook is for business-purposes and even that is becoming difficult to do. I look forward to a day when another platform takes over and allows freedom of speech for all!"
"This app was marketed to us 10-15 years ago as a great way to stay in touch with family, meet likeminded people in private groups where you could share opinions, and store photos. As the owner made billions off users like us, he then spit in our faces, and decided to use the platform as a purely political tool to silence and punish anyone with difference political views than him. To make matters worse he hired partisan groups that he labels “fact checkers” and has staff that hand out suspensions for posting anything even if true that goes against his own personal leftist views. In 2020 he used his platform to meddle in a US Election and obnoxiously posts alerts falsely declaring a winner all over his platform. He also tries to act as a judge and executioner declaring people mass murderers before they’ve had a day in court or a trial by jury. In the fall of 2020 he deleted millions of users’ accounts based solely on their political and religious beliefs. The owner of this platform is really scum of the earth. You are better off using Parler or Telegram where the owners don’t censor you for your religion or political views, and where the owners don’t interfere in US elections."
I have follow all the necessary prompts that i am suppose to take and every since i got my new phone but it won’t let me get back into the app at all when i have repeatedly taken four selfies on yesterday with me whole up different numbers and i have taken some other selfies with me whole up different other numbers today as well but by me repeatedly doing this i am putting myself at risk repeatedly doing the same thing over and over again and if you are a new user to Facebook don’t trust it if you get log out and can’t get back in because you switch mobile companies and you don’t have your old phone number or old mobile phone and if you more than Facebook post they won’t take that down neither once putting you at risk for hackers so if you are a new Facebook user don’t trust it if don’t be put at risk for haveing more than one Facebook page and post i will not give Facebook any type of ratings for haveing my identity expose in a manner in which i just stated in this paragraph it’s wrong and will be getting in touching with the Federal Trade commission center since i no way to deactivate all my pages and post.
"It works well for me, but I don’t use it much, except for keeping up with family and community groups. I don’t put much of my personal life on Facebook for safety of my children, and that’s why I think Facebook needs to have some kind of permission that allows a user to block certain words from showing on their profile. Mainly for tags, but also for comments. For example, I don’t want my child’s name shared on my FB page. I also don’t want any cuss words shared on my page. It would be nice to set up, like a text replacement so I could edit the one word on my page from, for example, Jeffrey to “J” or, just block the word entirely, i.e. “Happy Birthday, Jeffrey!” To “Happy Birthday [Hidden]” with a link imbedded in “hidden” explaining why FB didn’t hide the link, but the owner of the page did. 
You’re welcome. 
Also, it was like super difficult to find a place to suggest dev. I didn’t find it, so I had to come write a review. Hopefully you review them all."
"Okay so well I love the app. I get to talk to my family and join groups specifically the ones about animals and anime’s I like/have. 

But there’s just one thing that makes me mad. You guys took away my market place, I’ve contacted help and support so many times about it. I’ve gone to that stupid webpage that tells you steps and none of that stuff is even on my page like to request a review.

I did nothing wrong. I sold antique dolls my mom got when she was younger, I sold a model helicopter and a skateboard. That’s it. That’s all I was selling. And I was completely transparent in telling people the damages they had and pricing them reasonably. So I know I didn’t break any of your rules. I saw that it could be cause I was inactive. Sense I have become a lot more active. I’m on everyday, I update my profile picture all the time, I joined groups and I’m always talking in those. I even like and comment of some of my friends and families post so I know that being inactive isn’t the problem anymore. I also know that marketplace is in fact active where I live cause I’m in Texas! ALSO the entire icon is gone and hasn’t returned."
"It’s well known and publicly (and legally) documented that Facebook is a terrible corporation that seeks profit over protecting or empowering its users. This reality has only gotten worse over the years. Facebook is quick to remove posts and suspend and ban users and pages who are targets of racial, sexist, and otherwise discriminatory acts, but won’t remove or suspend the blatant hate speech of the clear perpetrators of violence on their app. Now they censor Palestinians under attack meanwhile they refuse to prevent or remove fake news specifically and overtly targeted at disempowering and harming people already oppressed.

Not to mention that now that the app is completely pay to play for pages and businesses, you won’t even see posts from brands you want to support. If you’re a small business owner, Facebook will block all your posts from being seen by the audience you’ve already built and relentlessly try to push you into paying for ads. They even flat out falsify the analytics on business pages to try to push small businesses to pay for an ounce of exposure to their own audience.

Hate this app."
"Many years ago Facebook was enjoyable, it was a great way to connect with people and share ideas. Over the last several years Facebook has become increasingly totalitarian. I can’t even scroll through my news feed without every other post having a flag on it because Facebook’s “independent fact checkers” have deemed it “false information”. Facebook has zero respect for free speech. The only thing worse than Facebook’s “independent fact checkers” is their gross invasion of users privacy. They track your exact location, your website history, and they use the microphone on your phone to record everything that you say. This happens every second your phone is on, regardless of if the app is opened or closed. What do they do with all of this information? They sell it to other companies for a profit, they use it to bombard you with ads that are very specific to you, and God knows what else. Mark Zuckerburg has become filthy rich off of invading the privacy of over 3 billion people and selling off that information. Sucker berg is a Nazi and a totalitarian and should be in prison for his crimes! Goodbye Facebook!"
"Facebook used to be my go to
Social media site. Within the past couple of months I have deleted it occasionally and then went for the complete delete just as of recently. It used to be a FUN place to share photos with family and friends and be SOCIAL. Now it has turned into a political platform, and a frustrating one at that. I was on a thread that was discussing a political topic and I was trying to share a :11 second video as REAL proof, and Facebook blocked it. I didn’t write anything in the post other than the video itself which was a bunch of people praying in a specific place. That was just the icing on the cake amongst other things that I have had issues with up until this point. The other issue is that I have tried reporting only a handful of things in my last 10+ years of Facebook, and the “we are looking into it” is ridiculous. You will be fast to fact check a post that I haven’t even uploaded, but when I report a post due to very obvious HIPPA violations it takes a matter of time until it is “reviewed”? Very frustrated. Will take my social media experience elsewhere."
"Like most other 1 star reviews I only put a star because I had to put something to leave a review. I got a warning for violating community standards. Next thing I know my account is disabled. I make a new account and it logs me off. I put in my password and it says it’s incorrect. So I try resetting my password. It won’t let me. So I have to look up my account. To do this I have to put in my name, phone number, or email account associated with my face book. I don’t have a phone number linked to my account yet so I put in my email. It tells me it’s wrong and there is no account linked. Then I put in my name. It tells me it’s wrong and there is no account linked. So I put in both at the same time for the same outcome. I get a notification on my tablet that I’m having trouble logging in. It tells me to click for one touch login. I login without having to put my email or password. I then proceed to my account settings where I find that my email account associated with my Facebook is what I thought it was. It wouldn’t tell me what my password was but let me change it on the spot no question asked."
"Please find a way not to show all your friends when you’re on FB. I sometimes like to zone out on FB just to pass the night. It is very very annoying to receive pop-ups in the wee small hours of the night from people (most often men) whom I barely know. There are no boundaries on Messenger. What I mean by this is that anyone can Message or even call anyone else whether they are friends or not. I have been harassed and annoyed in this manner also by a man who was drunk and didn’t want to take no for an answer in the middle of the night, calling on Messenger over and over again. I had to threaten to call police. How did he know I was awake and alone? Messenger!  It can also bring up trust issues with people in relationships who don’t know if their significant other is live chatting with a side piece or playing FarmVille in the wee small hours of the night. I’m a private person who likes to keep my business to myself. Find a way, please, to let the user decide whether or not they want to let anyone or no one pop up and interrupt their lives with Messenger. I regularly install and then uninstall, when it could just be so easy to fix it. Please do."
"I kept hoping Facebook would stop switching in app sounds back on and that they would also do away with trying to force me to create a passcode, but the undoing of my preferences by the app has become relentless. I have to switch off the app sounds daily. It’s obnoxious! I never wanted them in the first place. How many times will I have to inform the app that I want the sounds shut off for good? It is unpleasant to hear cheesy clicking and clacking sounds as you simply move from post to post on Facebook. Horrible idea.

It’s not only that. This is the largest most bloated battery sucking app there is. It bogs down my phone. What others have said about the updates consuming all of their storage is absolutely true. I wasn’t going to write a negative review even for the constant unnecessary toggling on of the app sounds, but every time there’s an update for this app there is no room for it on my phone. I have almost nothing on my phone. How is this app mobile friendly in any way? It’s a behemoth. I’m going to collect my personal photos and documents from it and delete it. I’ll happily find other places to socialize on the Internet. Sorry."
"So I had facebook like 4 months ago but i deleted my account because I never used it. I recently just downloaded it again and made a new account on the facebook website like on safari and I can log in and everything but when i tried logging into the facebook app it just says “error 100” or other things like that, I don’t quite remember right now, but it changes what it says many times. I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled the app many times. It also says the same thing on the Messenger app. Ive restarted my phone and i’ve turned it on and off many times. I’ve been trying to log into both the Facebook app and Messenger app for about 2 weeks now nothing has changed. I’ve also looked to see if i needed to update my Facebook app but it’s up to date. I can log in to facebook on safari or google but just not on the app which i found odd. I thought it was just maybe my account but I let one of my friends to try logging into their facebook account on my facebook app but the same error signs occur. I don’t know how to fix this. Also my iPhones up to date and everything."
"I’ve been on FB for a long time, and was amazed to see all of the recent bad reviews of it. The thing I like best about FB, is that you can see what family and friends are up to, check in with group pages you belong to, read articles people post, and laugh at funny memes. Different people post different things, so some friends may get political, some do not. You will see sides of people you know that have extreme positions on topics you would never have guessed. But you can keep scrolling, take a break from what they post, or defriend them. Some people are bent out of shape for getting blocked for posting fake news, but FB stepped up to letting people know when something was fake, rather than perpetuating things that aren’t true.  

Facebook is still a good app for what I always have used it for, staying in touch with family and friends."
"Besides FB blatant and obvious breach of our Uniform State Antitrust Act, it is still performing by looking into users privacy. Example, I attempted to get a new account using a different name but everything else was the same. I had my account immediately banded saying I did not adhere to FB guidelines. How do they know what my name, email or actual phone number is??? How is this protecting its users? This is why I dislike using my real info because companies like FB hack into my personal information. If my number and email are accurate why would they ban the account saying it was against guidelines? I don’t need my real name to look at Market place, especially if I’m just needing to shop and FB refuses to allow this UNLESS you have an account. We allowed this company to become the monster it is today. When will it stop? Nobody dares to compete because of the “wrath of Zuckerberg”! Who himself took this idea as his own in the beginning and buying Instagram and WhatsApp so he would not have ANY competition. I look forward to the day someone has the guts to compete and shut down FB and their illegal practices for good!"
"Never Ever use Facebook Marketplace to buy or sell anything especially with their Prepaid shipping labels. I tried it for the first time and sold an item instantly. Facebook generated and prepaid label for me I shipped the item out the next day. Facebooks policy is that you don’t receive funds until 15 days after shipping or 5 days after delivery. After a week, package was delayed for a week and buyer filed a claim for refund under a purchase protection plan Marketplace has established. I stayed in contact with buyer and all issues were resolved with shipping and the package was delivered and buyer was satisfied. Meanwhile Facebook decides the claim in the buy favor and refunds buyers money, now I’m out of my item and the money. Even though with Facebooks link tracking feature clearly showed buyer would receive item despite the delay. And as you all know Facebook support is a JOKE untold. I was told claim decision were final and haven’t heard from them since through email. There’s no number to talk to anyone and all of the support members look like they are just copying and pasting the reply with a different name attached. Never ever again!"
I haven’t been able to see anything about my account other than Facebook fake pages put on by hackers! Asking for me to open my account for me to sign in with email address password over and over. I don’t believe that it’s real please take them down. I’ve put my email and personal password for the? Whoever said that is what fb has you do?? I have had my identity stolen from someone I have turned in a lot of times has used it to get in my account! I sure I did things when I got back on Facebook my mistake please text me on what to do! My husband is going to ask me to close my account and I really enjoy see old friends have pictures I want but not all the trouble I keep getting. So Dear Facebook let me know if you have an answer for me to keep my account or close now it keeps asking me for a nickname I don’t have one so I’m sure you will never get this send
"I’ve never left a negative review before, but Facebook has certainly warranted my first one. I could go on rants about how they dictate political views, oppress freedom of speech and so forth, but that’s surprisingly not why I’m writing this. This company truly has the worst customer support I’ve ever encountered. Not only is personal information not secure, so much so that my account has been hacked numerous times, regardless how many of their “security steps” I go through or how complicated I make my new passwords. Recently, my account was hacked and the hacker got me banned from marketplace. I followed the steps to have the FB team review my account, which they deemed me to not be at fault for. They said it was all good and I should have access again. It’s been two weeks now of me reporting issues regularly and trying to contact any support. No dice. There’s literally no way to actually get help. They’ve done a great job and punishing me for their own lack of security. My overall experience with Facebook is negative 5 stars. I can’t think of a company I would like to give a worse review of."
"Every time I turn around they are changing some type of feature. I already hate the bubble inside the bubble pictures when someone posts in a group and it shows on my time line. Now they keep messing with how videos appear and watched. It's so annoying. I made a group and I thought it was so cool for the announcement video to play when people first visits the group for it was like an introduction but noooooooo, now that is ruined because Facebook wants to change how the video is viewed. That is so stupid like why even mess with all of these video features. So now we can't even be creative on Facebook? You guys already how 123,456,789 rules can we at least get creative with our profiles and groups? These video features are annoying. It's annoying that when I'm trying to quickly exit out of a video it just does a PIP and keeps playing. Like really? I exited out for a reason obviously. I think we should be asked if we want it to go PIP. Then as I mentioned earlier, the intro video I had for my group is just a small box and you can't even hear the video smh"
"I don't receive notifications when someone replies to my comment and tag me
When I leave a comment to a page I liked or a group that I am a part of, I dont'e get notified when someones replies to my comment or the thread of comments I have replied to. Turning on the notifications for the post is not the sollution because then I get notifications for every single comment. This is not what I want. I would like to get notifications when somebody replies specifically to my comments or my replies under a post. The only notification I get, is when someone likes my comment. The only way to see if someone replied to my comment is to find the post, then search for my comment and then see if someone replied. In some posts that hundrends of people are replying, this is extremely difficult. You might also get a replay and never see it because it happened a day or two after you left the comment. I have reported the problem several times and nothing has changed. A lot of people experience the same thing for a lot of years now and it is extremely frustrating."
"I’ve tried reinstalling it. There no option to clear cache on it. Not sure what else I can do here. It was working fine before. The app continues to crash after updating since dark mode was made available. It’s very frustrating. I miss all kinds of stuff since the newsfeed keeps refreshing and changing every time I launch the app. It doesn’t matter where I’m at. It lasts 7 seconds before the app crashes, but stays running in the background (meaning it’s still active in the background) I love dark mode, it helps with my VSS, but I haven’t experienced so many problems since it was made available, it might not be dark mode since it crashes even with it off. There’s no clear instructions on what to do in the help center for crashing, since there’s so many version updates. All questions are very general. Maybe the features that came out with dark mode need to be looked at."
"my husband and I setup our Facebook account in 2008 I think ... for at least 4 years we were “Carrie and Marc”... then suddenly, our account was locked and we were sent an email stating we violated their policy and they had right to believe we were misrepresenting ourselves. We were told we had to send them our picture ID to reopen the account.  We did. Then they arbitrarily decided the account would be my husband’s name only and we have never been allowed to change that. Well, FB is big brother and apparently FB wants to keep a close eye on my husband.  Take a peak around FB - how many fake Trump accounts are there? How many fake celebrity accounts are there? How many people use fake names in general!!?! We were using our real names all along, but since my husband happens to work in ammo/weapons industry, he’s apparently of interest to them.  Keep watching FB - we are pretty boring!! Want to see my son’s football game? Oh or maybe my dinner last night? Or for some teal juicy stuff, maybe you can catch me sharing a church service ... whoa now that’s something to report!!"
"It’s a horrible thing when hypocrisy is committed. You guys censor people with difference of opinions, but yet you guys cry for equality. Anybody that is a Christian or Conservative you censor their voice. You guys sit here and say that your censoring President Donald J. Trump because he is encouraging violence, but what about the thousands of people that are bullied each and everyday on social media? Why aren’t those bullies being censored? Why isn’t Nancy Pelosi, Kamala Harris, and Maxine Walters censored when they were telling people to riot? Why aren’t people being censored when they encourage violence upon the President of the United States? Why is it okay for celebrities to bully the President like Kathy Griffin did when she held the severed head of the President? Is it because it’s now a common trend to call somebody a racist and we go with it. It must be comfortable cowering behind the people that bought you out. You guys pick and choose who should be held accountable. I’m not saying the President is perfect, but I will sit here and say there has been a constant attack on him since he choose to run for President and very little censorship has been done to those who are against him."
"I am very unhappy with Facebook. The problem I have: I recently had my network compromised. This led to me to implement a number of security methods, update my devices, and sign out of devices. I also got my phone replaced (but kept the same number). I am unable to login because it is requiring my 2FA - however my old phone no longer has facebook’s metadata. I also logged out of my portal and iPad. This leaves me without a single previous device browser that has logged in and therefore I can’t approve my login from my new iPhone-x. I was then forced to send my license in order to regain access to my account. I have done this now three times in the 2 months I have not been able to access Facebook.  You have my license info, I have followed the form to get back access, and still no word. I attempted to call but you state you don’t take customer service calls. I have sent a DM to the Twitter account as well but still nothing... hoping this review pops to the top so someone might see it from Facebook and explain to me the voodoo I must do to get back access? DNA sample? Come on, get it together Facebook!"
"Facebook disabled my account without warning or notice, with a canned auto response explanation that I was accused of engaging in bullying, hate speech or terroristic threats, which is laughable because I have never done anything even remotely indicative of such things. I am a widowed 62-year-old grandmother who only used Facebook to stay up to date with family and friends, post family photos and to post best wishes to those celebrating birthdays, anniversaries or other milestones. In the blink of an eye, over 12 years of photos, connections and memories have been wiped out. I have no other way to reach out to people who I reconnected with through Facebook over the years. I tried everything under the sun to get my account reinstated, to no avail. Facebook has gotten too big, powerful and indifferent to the feelings of its members.  I am now using the MeWe social media platform, which is very similar to Facebook and I will encourage everybody I know the transition over there. Facebook needs some serious competition. Right now, they have a global monopoly over social media and they’ve become monsters."
"Updated review Nov 2019. Stop messing up the app. Fix the bugs, but stop tweaking it. Once again, when I go to Groups, I know longer see the Groups I belong to. This feature has gone away before; I reported it and it was restored. Now, after the latest update it’s gone again. 

A basic business adage is to ""keep it sold"" which means taking care of your current customers while you also develop new ones. You've already got millions of us sold on Facebook, so quit screwing around with the app and just give us a stable, reliable feed. Let the users decide what they see in their wall and in what order. I understand you make money from ads, so go ahead and put them out there, but let us manage our own content and interaction with our own friends, groups and pages. The more your developers keep tweaking with the app, the less appealing it becomes and the more unstable. Now it keeps freezing and quitting, making it difficult to post. Do you even ask your users what kind of changes they want before messing with the app & your stupid algorithms?"
"When it works, it’s really noce to be able to connect with people and see and share posts:) bit very disappointing when it doesn’t let you use it ever again and locks you out forever.:( Ok so I made an account on here and followed all and only the directions they gave me to set it up. When I finished, a random thing popped up and said that it saw “suspicious activity” from my account and made me send in a picture of myself to verify that it was really me. Then it said that my account would be disabled until they reviewed my submission. A month and a half later, it still says the same thing, so I tried making a new account. At first all was fine, but it did the same thing only five minutes after I completed the setup! I have no idea why it’s doing this. I did absolutely nothing wrong and the only reason I was making an account was so I could use Facebook marketplace. If anyone has any tips on how to fix this, please let me know!"
"Tom just wanted to be my friend. He didn’t try and bad touch me like Zucky does and he was not the bully that Zucky is. Tom let us speak freely and just sat there as our friend. Tom didn’t protect scammers and child molesters like Zucky does. Tom let us speak freely and did not shove political agendas down our throats. Tom didn’t monopolize social media and unfortunately this horrible and nasty bully came along and did exactly that.

 Zucky is selling your children’s pictures to the highest bidder to sex traffickers and you see the same photos posted every day for years of scam items and with all this facial and picture recognition you would think they would stop scammers and child molesters but they don’t. Probably because Zucky did have a friend named Jeffrey Epstein and he did not kill himself. 

I was going to maybe give them another chance then saw the reviews and it reminded me of how evil Facebook truly is. They are a socialist propaganda tool and if you say something they don’t like not only will they censor you and restrict you but they will ruin your business as well if you are a small business owner. How do you Facebook employees sleep at night?"
"What’s with the “fact checkers”?  There is no way a team of informed specialist could possibly be checking these posts.  I posted a joke stating that Marcus Welby indicated that anybody who drank Boonesfarm Wine in their youth was automatically immune to viruses.  FaceBook refused to post it and stated it wasn’t true.  OF COURSE IT WASN'T TRUE!!  It was a joke!!  Why was my joke not posted, but other political jokes that are lies about President Trump posted as if it were true?  I have posted true facts with my reference, but your group of fact checkers say it is not true with no explanation.  Get rid of the fact checkers!  I thought we had a country of free speech!  If a person cannot prove what they post, the ones who read it will know it is not true.  We do not need fact checkers, who are a bunch of Trump hating liberals and will not allow the truth to be posted.  To add to my complaint, why do you eliminate my updates?  Is it because it disagrees with your opinion?  What good is Facebook if the posts must first be approved by your fake fact checkers?  I have seen lots and lots of lies posted, but if they support the liberal agenda, they are not taken off."
"For some insane reason, I have never been able to get the Avatars feature to work for me. I have had 2 different phones and updated the app every time there is one available, and the link to go to it has never appeared under “See More” in the menu. After this most recent phone upgrade, I did notice when other people post avatar stickers, I can click below it where it says “Create Your Avatar”, but when I do so it says I don’t have the right version of the Facebook app to support the feature, and going to the App Store does nothing because it’s the latest version of the software. I have also deleted and redownloaded the app several times. Even going to the website through Safari on my phone and on a laptop I still can’t access it anywhere. I have reported the issue multiple times and never received a response from Facebook about it, I’m just completely confused as to why I am not able to create an Avatar whatsoever."
"Since FB has monetized itself, there are more and more ads!!!! Lately I can’t get through a 3 minute video without seeing ads!!! When FB started you could watch videos WITHOUT THE ADS!!! But as time went on FB is getting more and more monetized with ads!! It’s getting ANNOYING to the point where I’ve not finished a LOT of videos simply because there was an ad!!!! I keep putting a request to the app developers and that’s to let us have the option to PAY A ONE TIME FEE to become ad free. There are thousands if not millions of GAME apps that have that option, why not FB. Another reason I hate ads in videos is because IF you were to go to the movie theater they only play ads at the beginning, and let you watch the movie all the way through!!!! SURELY if a movie theater would start interrupting the movie to play an add to get you to buy more popcorn, SMACK in the middle of the film or especially MULTIPLE times during the film, everyone one would burn that theater down!!!! This is the same principle with videos on FB!!! PLEASE GIVE US THE OPTION TO PAY A ONE TIME FEE TO NO LONGER SEE ADS!!!!!!"
In a blink of an eye I lost my entire platform due to a hack. I was on a live on my business page and during that time my personal account was hacked and my account was flagged. My account was immediately disabled which meant I lost access to my business page as well. I’ve built my business for over two years and in a blink of an eye everything was gone. I’ve emailed every single email I could find and even had created another profile so I could send a support email. I had adds running that I’ve now lost revenue on. NOT ONE REPLY and it’s been WEEKS!!! I want refunded the hundreds of dollars I had out in adds and would appreciate access back to my business account but they have zero customer service and I’m a PAYING CUSTOMER. This platform is a joke and they wonder why everyone is leaving it and going elsewhere. I’ve created a new account and within 5 days that account glitched and I can’t like comment or post which again means the new business account I created I can’t use!!! I have lost hope at this point. Thanks Facebook for not caring about your paying customers. -Jenny Greene
"Facebook is amazing, it is one of the top social platforms and it definitely keeps up when it comes to that name! You meet amazing people! It is GREAT socially and REALLY GREAT for businesses too! As far as everything honestly it’s the best! The ONLY ONLY ONLY thing I would fix is like the feed having more on it.. what I mean by that is for example: if I’m scrolling awhile through my feed and then set my phone down and go back to my feed 30 minutes later I am seeing all the SAME posts I JUST seen half an hour ago and it’s actually starting to make me use the app less.. I think Facebook needs to make it a little easier to discover new people or it COULD let us just see the posts ALL our friends are making atleast..
But this is by no means a mad or hate comment just a suggestion and I’ll be using Facebook until Facebook dies which will probably be never I hope 💋"
"1. Why do we need Facebook messenger as a separate app? That’s stupid. 
2. Marketplace is where I sell a lot of old items from around my house and I love the service and how I can offer shipping for it. It’s also cool that you can set up a business on the app through marketplace. BUT the marketplace is NOT user-friendly. It’s so confusing to list an item and it’s also very confusing to look at your “store front” to take a look at what you have listed. Get it together, Facebook. 
3.  STOP ASKING ME ABOUT MY COVID SHOT. NOBODY CARES. 
4. Kind of goes with the above, stop being so political, Facebook. I use this app to stay connected with family and things of that nature and it is worth dealing with it being so annoying in this nature, in order for me to have contact with family and friends…. But we’re riding on a very thin line where I will probably deactivate my account and use another platform for selling items and connecting with family if the political crap keeps it up and lack of user-friendliness."
"I have never been more annoyed with fact checking than I have on Facebook. This is seriously the stupidest concept ever and I’m so disgusted with Facebook’s belief that they think they have to fact check everything that is posted. Do they seriously think we are too stupid to do our own fact checking? Do they except me to actually believe that their fact checking is non biased or bipartisan? They can say all they want that it’s fair but God gave me a brain to use and I know how to use it and I don’t need anyone telling me how to think. I can think for myself! It’s only a matter of time before their so called “fair” fact checking will prove to be worthless. I actually hope this fact checking ruins them because they have ruined social media along with Twitter and other social media platforms. You want to be a leader Facebook? Try giving people a chance to think for themselves instead of telling us how to think. If this continues to get worse, I have no problem deleting and never logging back in. I know many others feel the same way."
I am sending this with one star rating because it won’t let me send zero star rating. A $450 Grill I ordered arrived at my home today.  I am 74 and have health issues which makes me high risk for corona virus. Since I could not buy it at a store because of the virus for the first time I bought directly from Char Broil’s web page. I was shocked to return from a doctor’s visit  to find a 140 pound box dumped in the middle of my driveway blocking the steps to my deck and side door.  I called Char Broil and explained why I needed to return the grill. I thought it would be partially assembled. They refused to take it back because I should have known how it would be packaged. They did not care about any health concerns I had about shopping in a store and were not responsible for how Fed Ex delivered it. They said it was my responsibility to find someone to move it to my deck and put it together. For the past 20 years I have had nothing but Char Broil Grills at my home but I always bought them from Walmart’s  or Lowe’s with a return policy.  I have learned a hard lesson.  If you buy a Char Broil Grill DO NOT BUY IT DIRECTLY FROM CHAR BROIL but buy it from a vendor.
"I remember back in the day when Facebook was a place to connect with friends and see what everyone was up to, now it’s just a bunch on useless videos and ads I don’t care to see, plus it’s gotten a lot more dangerous for the younger audience, allow me to explain.. I saw this group called new friends or something like that and I was browsing through it, just looking at what all everyone was posting and I saw younger kids posting on there like ages 13-15 and under there comments I saw full grown adults asking to marry them and to be with them and so on. Keep in mind these are grown men, a few of them looking to be in their late 30s or early 40s getting on groups like these to try and attract and lure kids it seems and nothing is ever done about it.. I miss the old days of Facebook where you got on, played some Farmville and chatted with a few friends. Anymore this site is a complete joke with a bunch of bugs and glitches that are never fixed with creeps going on groups for malicious intentions, and don’t even get me started with the whole fact checkers..."
"(Facebook Is racist!!!) Read this. I have used For over 10 years. This App is Ran by super far left. I’m still confused on How I get 30 days in Facebook Jail. From a Picture I got from a Facebook Group that’s has over 2million followers. and I’m the one getting 30 days. The picture wasn’t nude or Violet. Didn’t promote nothing bad. It was Joe Biden On his knee with Chines President holding him on a leash. Because we Know the Truth. Facebook don’t have to fact Check me. Joe wasn’t on live tv, Telling on him self he was holding money back from Ukraine. I watched it on CCN New, CMBC, Fox and others. But Facebook wants to hide everything that’s going on in the country and the world. I would not Download this app.!!! They Have comment bot that reads all comments people type and if they don’t agree what you say. Soon as you make that post they give 30 day Facebook Jail. You can’t do anything just look and scroll. Like really 30 days! Like Come On!!!!! ((( Don’t post anything about Islam or freedom of speech On Facebook )) They will Delete your account!  Like they my 2! With my kid pictures and everything!"
"Facebook fact-checkers: ALL of you are criminals!!!! You will never be able to walk down the street alone again once people find out what you’ve been doin. How do you sleep with your head on that pillow at night? Do you sleep? Do you cry for the thousands of voices who’ve been silenced tryin to protect their families with vital information on the vaccines? Do you feel anything? I hope and I honestly do believe that GOD is in charge here now.. he’s gonna show the people who you all really are. How deranged and sick you are for allowing this censorship to continue. I would say to put my Facebook page back on, but I don’t really care anymore. You’ve lost my trust and my respect. To whoever reads this, you better ask yourself right now if you having a job as a Facebook fact-checker was worth the pain you’re about to experience when everyone finds out what you’ve done. Sleep well.. I know I will, knowing God will take care of each and every one of you unless you start speaking out for the people. You’re cruel and heartless if you don’t. You have to live with that... choose wisely, God is Watchin."
"Since I can no longer log in to my account that I have had since 2008 I will complain here in hopes it gets me some help (not gonna hold my breath though). I never had an issue until 2 days ago when someone hacked my account & changed my email, password and anything else I had set up to help me recover my account. The link emailed to me to recover does not work, it says its invalid. I have done EVERYTHING the crappy help section says to do and still nothing. The fact that there is no actual technical support for FB is disappointing. When adding this app it should have a pop up say, “Welcome to Facebook where Hackers are welcome to take over as many accounts as they like and to everyone else, May the odds be ever in your favor”. After all from the things I have read since being hacked I would not be surprised if the majority of FB accounts are actually hacked accounts that have been reported but never taken down. Most people just create a new account after being hacked but I won’t. The disappointment of losing 13 years of memories & photos was enough for me. Do better FB🤦🏻‍♀️"
"I use Facebook a lot. I run a group where I am a big advocate of scheduled posts. I post about 15 times per day using this method and schedule my posts out a month at a time, and then go in and move things around as needed. Sometime between the last time I managed my groups posts a week ago and today the scheduled posts option in the group disappeared. Now I have to go on the desktop site on my computer, scroll through about 200 posts, reschedule a single post, the page refreshes, and then I have to scroll through 200 posts again to edit the next one. Previously the app would allow me to make all of my edits, and then refresh all at once and check to make sure everything was good. I could edit 100+ posts and only refresh and scroll through all my posts once or twice. This update just killed my group because now I’m no longer interested in scheduling the posts, and I don’t have time to make the posts daily which is why I scheduled them in the first place. I downloaded the new Facebook creator studio and it only supports pages, not groups."
"I, and many other of my friends and family, have been placed in “Facebook Jail,” over posts that “go against community standards.” Here is my issue: NOTHING that has caused this has been against these standards, but these posts and comments are pinpointed by AI for “trigger words” (ie curse words). The problem is that AI is being triggered over what we type, though it is harmless, meanwhile memes that ARE against FB standards are being let through by this same AI system, because they are pictures and therefore not as heavily monitored. 

I truly wish there was a viable Facebook competitor, because they are truly awful; if I could give negative stars for the sole reason of their monitoring systems, I would. Unfortunately app review doesn’t allow that, so my negative rating is in the title. 

If you haven’t yet been sucked into Facebook to keep up with your friends, do yourself a favor and don’t even start. It isn’t what it used to be, and I contemplate getting rid of it daily, but it would cut out my friends from thousands of miles away, whom I can no longer see due to moving."
"I can't look at more than a handful of recent post from friends unless I increase my friend count, so I have to accept people I don't speak to, or constantly check in all day. I will do neither. Facebook was always a good idea to keep in touch with that group of close friends and family that have grown physically distant over the years. I don't want to participate in a popularity contest. And all that being said, it would be fine to keep running in the background on my phone for when I really want to tell my friends something. 
What's really got me bothered is the inability to stop Facebook from pushing things at me. I don't care what celebrities got the shot, I follow no famous people. So I hide the post and it tells me I'll see less of this in the future. Apparently when they say the future they mean in 10 minutes, because here we go with more covid news. I don't watch any news organizations, I don't idolize any franchise of films, I don't care about human interest stories and I don't like any of your idiot politicians. Leave me alone and let me say hi to my friends."
"How about point seven five(.75*)stars as Suckerberg and/or his minions demonstrate schizophrenic decision making when picking and choosing when or how content is inappropriate. What is left on one page is censored from another. Oh they allow a review but no opportunity to self edit after the review before arbitrarily throwing you into a F’Book timeout rendering the review absolutely pointless and useless as they have completely shut you down like the parents of spoiled children as when after little Markie has had his wee widdle fee-fees hurt. I have enjoyed F’Book for the past 10 years and resisted most other social media platforms but starting this very day will starting to build a presence elsewhere where hopefully less sensitive little whiners will better administer or at least better partner with their participants in the editing process. So I say use F’Book but N-E-V-E-R count on it or its representatives for anything like support. I’m glad I never gave up my support of MySpace even now as loyalty which F’Book apparently has no relationship with is very important to me. Instagram, Twitter... here I come!"
"I used to love that my friends and I could post freely about anything and get a laugh. Now, even jokes are being “fact checked” and inundated with FB’s views. I don’t use Social Media to be told how to think; I use SM to connect with friends and have a good time. The “fact checks” and FB notes on everything have truly become a hinderance from enjoying the app. Some of my friends will not even use it anymore because of all the BS. Let people judge information for themselves and have fun with their friends or start calling it Censored Media because it’s getting less and less social. I’m also pretty close to calling it quits with FB because I’m tired of my friends and I feeling we cannot communicate freely without FB looking at each and every one of our posts, even jokes, and pin pointing what is false about our posts. 95% of the time, the “fact-checkers” do not even provide facts that have anything to do with reason I posted what I did. Anyway, FB needs to figure out its priorities; is it to allow people to be social or is it to be information police. Defund the information police!"
"I am a member of a lot of groups and rely on my email notifications to decide which posts to actually read and which to ignore. Unfortunately, FB made that impossible several months ago when, during an update, my email notifications suddenly became two lines instead of the full post. I’m assuming that was to force me to visit FB more often. What’s worse, is that in a recent update, when I click on the “view on Facebook” button in the email notification, instead of taking me directly to the post I want to read, FB now takes me to a random video in the FB watch tab. Presumably to get me to watch more videos. But all it’s doing is frustrating me to no end. Now, the latest, is when I manually try to find the post I want to read by looking at my notifications tab, the post doesn’t show up until I refresh the group page, which never used to be the case. It is all a downward spiral that makes me wish I could just stop using FB and try something else. Stop updating the app to make it less convenient for users!"
"Newest update has caused me to no longer receive notifications on the platform itself (not just push notifications/alerts), but I receive no notification at all. I realized this was happening a few days ago after seeing posts from friends to my timeline, comments and mentions whilst scrolling through timeline but noticed that I’d never gotten any alert to the activity. I’ve even watched my husband send me invitations and tag me in comments on posts and received nothing in my end. 
The last update was released 4 days ago and I’ve had this active issue for 3... I’ve logged out and back in, deleted and reinstalled the app, rebooted my phone, checked my account elsewhere in a new browser window, double checked my notification settings... all to no avail. 
I use Facebook to keep in touch with friends and family, especially now, so it’s even more irksome that I’m missing out on anything that may be being shared with me and the possibility that I may never see/know if I missed anything. Very frustrating. 
This is a basic feature - please fix it ASAP."
"I have been a Facebook user for over 9 years and had great memories shared with friends along with photos and all removed with no notification! Was on Facebook 5 days ago now one morning from watching a video on Facebook watch then 10 minutes later I was logged off without notice! I tried logging back onto my account and was asked to present Identification, I sent it and no response back whatsoever to this day. Currently it states “information received, due to the Covid situation they have fewer staff and may be unable to review the account”! I’m very disappointed in this app! it also removed my account along with my instagram account and messenger app, it’s so devastating to a person that absolutely never done anything to violate the Facebook community policy! 😔I guess we are to blame for even putting so much trust in Facebook. Until Facebook make changes I will not be back, I will not make a new profile or give you all any advertising! Mark Zuckerberg I hope you make the proper changes, it’s a real shame when MySpace looks better right about now 🥴"
"Today, Buttons are missing with the latest update.  I’m showing 48 notifications on the app badge. When I only have one. When I go into my notifications list within the app… I have well over 48 new notification showing and they are all out of order. Nowhere near chronological order one will be from a day ago that I’ve already open six times… And another will be from five minutes ago and then another one from 37 minutes agoAnd yet another one from 16 hours ago… It’s just ridiculous unable to figure out what the heck happened. By the way the Covid button from the menu bar at the bottom of the iOS app is now gone and it’s only in the menu which is totally fine by me. I really wish that we were able to choose which buttons we wanted at the bottom of our Facebook main application because I would prefer to have a button that lets me see everything in the newest order I would like more control over my main views and views within each sub menu as well"
"I’ve been a faithful Facebook user for years. It is my go to social media platform and I love it. However for the last couple months I’ve noticed it won’t load random things. Images, comments, and video will stop loading if I’ve been scrolling for a minute or two. Sometimes I’ll be just hopping on and comments won’t load for something. It doesn’t matter if I’m on WiFi or data. I’ve even gone as far as to uninstall it and reinstall it twice this week, which worked for that night and stopped the next day. I never used to have this problem until after I got the iPhone X. My husband just switched phones to the iPhone X like me (got mine on Mother’s Day) and now he experiences it too, and we have friends who say they noticed it as well on this phone but when they switched phones, it was all good. Is there possibly a compatibility flaw between Facebook and the new iPhone? I hate not being able to use it like I used to. Hopefully this can be fixed so we can keep using it."
"When I open the app I can only see a handful of posts from days ago. When I scroll to the bottom, the app doesn’t load any more posts. Refreshing does nothing. I don’t get any error messages. On the posts that do show up: 1. comments don’t load at all 2. videos freeze after max 10-15 seconds 3. when I react to or comment on something it never actually posts it; next time I load the app and see the post I commented on, my both my comment & reaction don’t show up. 
Today it got to the point that when I opened the app, it just says “network error, tap to retry” and of course tapping “retry” does nothing. 
I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app multiple times. The first time seemed to fix it but the next day it was acting up again. The second time it started acting up within a few hours. This time it went from “tap to retry” to just acting buggy. The app keeps degrading to the point where I literally cannot use it on my phone which is my main source of using Facebook; I rarely if ever go on Facebook on the computer. This needs to be fixed so I can actually use your product."
"Facebook used to be enjoyable but now they are the absolute worst of all the social media. Their liberal community standards is a complete joke. Once they know you are a conservative they will target you and they will suspend your account numerous times for 30 days and then they will just shut it down completely. You can email called do whatever you want they will not respond and they will not allow you to download your information once they permanently suspend your account. They have went back as far as two years into my timeline and then giving me 30 days for stuff that I posted, that I found on Facebook. Once you are a target they will continually suspend you until you’re gone. Hopefully Trumps social media will be successful because Facebook will lose millions of people. Mark deserves that because he created the weak FB standards. What’s even more ridiculous is Mark owns Instagram and you can post stuff on there and nothing happens. The same stuff that gives you 30 days suspension on Facebook. Stay weak Mark."
"Facebook calls itself a “social media platform.” But really this app is just a personal data harvesting and advertising delivery machine. Facebook’s algorithm controls the posts you see so you see more paid content, and 1 in every 3 posts is an ad for something. The posts you do see from people you sort of know are usually posts from your racist Trump supporting uncle, because those posts have gotten a lot of engagement (usually likes and hearts from your uncles racist friends, or because you  argued with them ONE TIME in the comments and now Facebook’s algorithm thinks you’re best buds and want to see even MORE of their racist garbage.) oh, and Facebook tracks you everywhere you go on the internet in order to collect lots of data on you so they they can know everything about you because they’re so sure you just love love love all those personalized ads the bombard you with.
Apple really needs to ban this app from the App Store until Facebook comes clean about what the app really is, and stop calling it a “social media” app. Seems like a clear violation of App Store policy to me."
"Facebook used to be the place to be. We could connect with friends and family all over the world and share ideas, common or not common and talk without ever thinking we would be silenced. This past several years during a Presidential election FB has really shown the bias towards anyone who doesn’t share their views. Post that are factual censored. Post that should be shared for people to see gone. Presidential election rigging with the help of media and Facebook. Even to the point of putting a “fact check” on any political post regarding Donald Trump but nothing regarding the others. Unless of course you were sharing info about Hunter Biden. Fb has allowed the Russian collusion hoax to be spread over and over without any “fact checking” but allows others to defame the President without regard. Now with all that is going on, election results not certified or released, litigation throughout the entire thing FB still proudly representing Joe Biden as President elect. I’m tired of seeing these non truths be displayed and real actual information censored. Facebook has become nothing more than a place to play games again."
"Month or so ago, some important pages just stopped loading completely. I have no access to profile information unless someone has their join date in their public information, and I can’t access the settings page at all. Every time I try to open either of those, the app shows a loading icon for about a second before giving me the “An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.” message, and nothing I do fixes it. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, which didn’t fix anything. I’ve tried restarting my phone, and I’ve  All it did was initialize app settings, which means I have the god awful app sounds on with no way to turn them off. I’ve reported the issue to Facebook MULTIPLE times, but obviously nothing has been done. Two basic but important functions of the app are just completely broken, and the it seems like the devs are refusing to fix it. I’m going to keep reporting the issue until it gets fixed, but considering how long it’s been going on, I’m not holding my breath."
"I'm not going to be as mean as some of the reviewers I've seen.  I used to like the app before the recent update.  But now it's really slow when scrolling.  I'm not sure what I think about the side bar interface.  And the new ""grouping"" feature on my latest updates page just make it cluttered and hard sift through. I recommend going back to the old model, it worked a lot better. Do that and I bump the review from 2 stars to 4, if you don't, I delete the app and close my profile.

Update: I’ve apparently not deleted the app in the years since I posted this, at this point 2 star rating is dropping to 1 star.  A new complaint, we need to be able to turn off the auto-refresh feature on iPhone, even if it is an old model 6.  Sometimes I’ll close out the app to do something else but would like to continue from where I was at when I closed, but when I go to open the app it auto-refresh's and lose whatever post I was reading and my page is cluttered with a buttload of more non-sense."
"Ever written a comment then decided, “ehhhhh…. Not worth it.” So you scroll to look at other comments but your unsent comment is just vibing at the bottom of the screen in the way and then you click away and get the dreaded question: Continue or Go Back? Click continue and you are back at your unsent comment. Click Go back and you are back at your unsent comment. How about hitting cancel? Oh wow would you look at that- it’s your unsent comment, here to say hello once again. Please for the love of a hopefully Smiling God, please stop the torture. Release me from the purgatory that is my own cringe on the internet, don’t make me face my cringe and delete it myself just do it for me I’m really important and have important things to do, how am I supposed to get anything done if I have to spend less than 30 seconds deleting my 5 paragraph essay on something I literally know nothing about?? It’s cringe and I don’t want to confront that, could you do it for me? Please, I am begging you this is not a joke."
"I joined Facebook back in 2008-ish. I was a junior in high school and it was fun to post updates, play some poker, add those funny buttons (basically the first memes) to my wall. I even met my husband through Facebook. But Facebook has gradually declined over the years into a black hole of clickbait trash articles, overly opinionated dicks (I was one of them too, Facebook brings out the worst in people), and just too much information and stimulation. I disabled my Facebook almost a year ago and the previous year I had barely gotten on it at all after reading “Digital Minimalism” by Cal Newport. But even before reading that book I knew that Facebook was making me and others more agitated, opinionated, overwhelmed, self absorbed, and self conscious. I won’t even touch on the crisis of misinformation that has plagued the site. I’m happier without Facebook (and honestly I’ve gotten rid of all social media from my phone and it’s great). After two years without it, I feel pretty good about my decision that it just isn’t for me anymore. Same for Instagram. I’m gonna go live my life now."
"This app is a flaming hot garbage barge flowing through a  sea of heaping excrement. WHEN you finally manage to get the app to work, it works for all but 10 minutes before figuring out a new glitch to annoy you by. 
After being suspended for 2 MONTHS for telling someone to buy rogaine (someone apparently reported this comment?) I was able to get my account back. Within 30 minutes of being back online the app crashed 3 times, forcing me fully log back in twice, will give me an error message to try again while trying to update my profile picture, changed my app array at the bottom to show gaming which i’m not interested in at all, and now, it won’t even show me my profile in my menu! 

Aside from actual app issues, facebook is ridiculous with in censoring that using the site almost feels like you’re treading on a layer of lego pieces strewn about your floor with the addition of broken glass. Everybody's feelings are hurt over something, there are too many features that don’t even work, and the app is horrendous in terms of being user friendly. This sucksssss"
"I am very frustrated because my account, which I’ve had since middle school, was disabled with no given reason. It wanted me to provide my ID to confirm that I am indeed me, however, its been 3 days already and still nothing. Unfortunately I cant even access the email associated with my FB account because I created it the same time I joined FB, so I cant even guess my security question or remember any passwords that I’ve used for that email in the past. I thought I did connect it to another one of my personal emails, but none of those worked in helping me recover my account. I am very disappointed that my account was deactivated even though I haven’t posted in months. I have used messenger (and also Instagram) quite frequently to connect with all my friends and family for years until this happened. 

In desperation I tried to create two new accounts with new emails but even those were disabled. FB, please - if this ever gets reviewed, long time users like me deserve an explanation as to why our accounts were suddenly disabled."
"I am literally hating facebook so much! Every update to “make facebook better” is a scam! Everything gets changed every 2 week and that’s not to mention such a trashy algorithm. For starters I am being charged $25 on my new page for ads when I have never run an add on this page. However it still telling me my card is not going trough and I’m just soo confused as to why am I being charged, thankfully I have never put down my card information. Tried contact them and see why it’s saying I owe $25 dollar but no response... customer service is just trash and non existent. Every time I upload a video or a prerecorded storie it takes several hours and sometimes days to actually upload ... that’s ridiculous!! 
My all time favorite was instagram but now facebook owns instagram too and little by little instagram is becoming trash too. To upload a video is taking longer than ever.. and now the inbox messages are blue? Eww 
Honestly so over this 2 app I honestly wish someone else comes up with a better social media app and I promise id be deleting these 2 soo fast. Everything they do they just make everything worse"
I have been a holdout since Facebook started. I finally gave in so I could see what was going on with family.  This has been the most stressful annoying experience ever.  No tech support while developer Mark is a billionaire.   I also several times a week only have about 6 items and the feed ends.  Log out and back in. Did setting for a couple people to be on the top of my feed.  Never are.  My daughter is trying to Like things and gets a ‘this action is blocked ‘ reply and tells it 20 times that it’s a mistake and then it happens again.  Then it locked her account.   Then you have to identify 5 people who are friends to convince FB that you are still really you.  Then she had to change password two different times in two days and she’s an expert at this app.  Ruining my vacation trying to post our things and encounter glitch after glitch.  Oh log out AGAIN!!!! Try AGAIN!!   By the volume of all these crappy reviews I would think the boss would want to fix these bugs and actually be an above standard app.   Guess you don’t care anymore once you get really rich.   Hate this app.
"7/3/18 new review: I can’t go 5 seconds without this app kicking me out of it. Also, what happened to the feature where when you went to post a pic, if you tapped and held the pic you could edit it before posting? Seriously over this app. I’m about to delete it and just use safari, because it’s got so many issues and just not worth it anymore. I now have the 8 plus and have had nothing but issues since I updated the other day. 

Old review: So my FB app was working fine until I updated it. I have an iPhone 6 Plus and I use the app to upload photos of my daughter. Well after I updated it I went to upload photos and the app closed out on me, it freezes when I try to go back on it, it won't let me upload more that 40 photos/videos at a time, it's sluggish when it will let me on, and no matter how many times I turned my phone off or uninstalled the app and reinstalled it it's still doing the same thing. I'm over it. When the app is running better and won't kick me off of it while trying to upload photos let me know, but until then I'm deleting it and using safari."
"If I could give it no stars I would. AS OF TODAY, i am in Facebook jail and reading comments under a post in one of my groups about a guy having problems with his car. He starts calling someone the n word along with all sorts of names, and this kids WHITE. How am I being blocked for non-aggressive or hurtful comments but this mfer can be outwardly racist and hateful? I’ve had Facebook since 2009 and never had a problem with being restricted or banned until the past year or two. Every time I’ve been banned, it’s for posting a response to someone being nasty to me about not liking trump. I usually will respond with a link citing why I dislike trump and explaining the incident, yet the other people get off fine and Facebook tells me I’m banned for seven days. I wait the seven days out, and then boom I’m banned for THIRTY days after that. This system is run by bots clearly, I don’t like knowing that a platform designed for humans is being moderated unquestionably by machines. Hire a few g$&&amn interns to moderate comment threads the right way. Deleting my account after I’m out of Facebook jail."
"App was updated 4 days ago to make it load faster. Now it won’t load at all. Keep getting community standards violations for cooking recipes. Got violations for a car made out of snow. Yet pictures of women with their whole p*ssy hanging out don’t go against community standards. Yes, I have reported some of the pictures to test my theory. Facebook says sexually explicit pictures of women are not against community standards. However, if a picture of a man even shows the shadow or outline of a Penis it goes against community standards. Violations are given out for repeating the same word too many times in the same post. Excuse me Facebook! Not everyone has an exponential vocabulary. Words are oft times repeated in prayers, poetry and song lyrics. Does that make them bad enough to violate your one sided biased community standards? How about exhibiting some common sense in these issues? How about being able to recognize sarcasm? How about you don’t search back through years to give a violation on minuscule status? How about you stop violating our right to free speech? As long as it isn’t hate speech or threats leave it be."
"The App Store description reads connect with friends and family who have the same interests as you. No you can’t. Not if you’re conservative. If I want to share conservative links such as a Franklin Graham commentary on “Reverand” Warnock’s support of abortion, which is not Biblical, highlighted in the National Facebook, Facebook would not let me share the National Reporter article with Franklin Graham’s commentary, only the National Reporter article could be shared. Also, in my notifications of conservative link updates, when I touch the notification, it doesn’t take me directly to the article. I have to look at the time stamp, and scroll back through several articles to reach it. I experimented and followed liberal sites like Vox. This issue does not exist when following liberal pages and posts. I touch the notification and Facebook takes me directly to the article. I don’t have to scroll several articles back. All of their fact checkers are liberal. Non of them are bi partisan or non partisan. Totally liberal and misleading factcheckers"
"When has Facebook and Mr. Zuckerberg become judge and jury on our freedoms of speech?  Regardless of being a private company you should allow fairness in freedom of speech to ALL, not just the left and censor the right.  Facebook has moved so far away from it's initial intentions of simply connecting family and friends and has turned into, as most social apps have, a greedy, money hungry political venture.  They track so much info, regardless of privacy settings, they throw ad after ad after ad at you with no feature of simply not seeing any ad at all if we choose. Here shortly I will be deleting this app as thousands upon of thousands already have and will await for a platform,a fair and honest platform to be made that keeps to it's initial purpose for family and friends to stay connected.  Facebook is not it anymore as many others like Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram are not either and have deleted those already.  I'm sure this will be deleted by Facebook and not even read and definitely not posted as it contains truths and we all know truths aren't allowed anymore."
Facebook would be 100% more comfortable in my opinion if the messaging system was in the ACTUAL Facebook app. I mean come one think of storage??? Also it’s just annoying every time it takes me to the other app. It’s just as acting like Snapchat and it doesn’t do the best job. I would also recommend having the settings be a little more comfortable and less confusing for everyone thank you. I would also recommend NOT having soooo many “suggestions” it’s so annoying and it’s so crowded. I would also like my feed to NOT RESET every time. it is VERY difficult to find a post when almost nothing is in order and TOO MANY suggested posts appear!! I would also like an option to be able to delete EVERY SINGLE post. It would also be MORE comfortable(in my opinion)to have the RESHARED POSTS be on a different category to posts I ACTUALLY made. Because seriously it doesn’t make sense!!! My feed is a mess and honestly idk if it’s because I haven’t been on the app much but please being on the app is sometimes is irritating. Thank you have a great day.
"I watch a lot of video clips from different channels on Facebook.  Some channels might have a few good ones, but not enough for me to officially follow them.  The watch recommended still shows me videos I’ve either seen already or have said to hide the video because I’m not interested in it.  On clips that I’m in the middle of watching and Facebook reboots itself, they disappear and I rarely ever find them again.  The Activity Log would be really helpful if it would let you click to go back to the exact video (or at least list what channel it’s from) instead of just saying you watched a video on whatever date.  You want to monitor what I do, at least make it helpful to me.  I’ve noticed with this last update that the skip forward and back buttons are no longer available on videos.  That quality of life feature needs to come back and be left alone!  I’d also LOVE to be able to hide all videos from a certain channel that I’m not interested in."
"I am a very private individual. I keep my friends list very limited to under 20 people tops (mostly family and not even friends & co-workers) so that I can share video and photos with them about life events. I also post news commentary. I know about the NSA thing with Snowden. This is not what has upset me. Now, Facebook is publicly threatening that instead of just the algorithm and a relatively small team of content curators based out of Facebook's HQ, they are planning to hire an army of up to 20,000 human content police! I have real fears that one of these 20,000 strong may end up being a nosy neighbor down the street. I don't like the idea of having 20,000 people capable of seeing my posts that I don't even know who they are. The NSA is in Maryland, Facebook is in California. I was not worried about people from either of those groups being a neighbor living next door to me that I do not want to have access to my information! I am very weird in what I post (ufo stuff). Im sick of having to worry if my neighbor might happen to be a Facebook mod, like those in the website Nextdoor in which I am constantly tearing up snail mail invites for."
"This app has had many levels of disappointment over the years with never ending updates that primarily felt like ruining the experience and not enhancing it, but we put up with it to enjoy the ability to connect with family and friends from near and far or get information on our favorite local establishments. That said, the recent changes with extreme levels of silencing conservative voices and opinions is nothing but suppression of any thoughts or ideas that are not in lockstep with the socialist agenda. Our lively interaction with contacts has been transformed into a battlefield of trying to navigate word landmines and not end up in jail or locked out from contacting our people for simply speaking one’s opinion. So much for the first amendment rights of a free country. It’s especially disappointing and frustrating when there are obvious violent and dangerous posts from opposing viewpoints that seem to be allowed without any issue. What happened to enjoying the art of engaging in lively arguments with friends of varying points of view and agreeing to disagree?"
"Ten years ago, when I first got the Facebook app, I was so excited to have such a cool app—a way to stay in touch with friends & family. Facebook has grown exponentially since then, and I continued to marvel at all the cool new features offered. But, now I notice a huge change in Facebook that has worried me. Facebook has become politicized and acts in nefarious ways to shut down free speech. This is worrisome & saddens me. For Facebook to have special protections from our government, protections that have allowed Facebook to grow & make a lot of people hyper wealthy, and then for Facebook to use its power as a social platform to stifle speech it does not agree with, is using its power in totally inappropriate ways. Facebook should be proud to offer its platform as a means for public debate, something always healthy in a democratic Republic. But what I’ve been seeing in this last year has troubled me. Facebook seems to be losing its way & not remembering what its customers loved about it in the beginning. I hope Facebook will see my comments as constructive criticism and make changes."
"Dear Facebook CEO, This is RIDICULOUS to not have a customer service line in your line of business. My account has been hacked, and I have had multiple people report my page. There should have been a more through verification for verifying accounts. Like FaceTiming someone or using messenger to verify. I have now been hacked for almost a month. The fact that I have not been able to talk to someone is beyond me. And the fact that I have tried to create another account and cannot even get into this one due to being disabled which I’m unsure as to WHY. Now I am unable to use your services and will now have to possibly make multiple police reports due to hackers having my identification!! I also other multiple  forms of ID and can also verify post and former seeings on my Facebook account. I know you all have to keep a log of when accounts information was changed.  I am needing to speak with someone as soon as possible, not an automated email. A LIVE PERSON!! Please I can be contacted via email or by phone. Or I will need to seek legal and professional help!!"
"Facebook has become my most hated and hard to navigate app. I get useless notifications every day when a random person posts in a group I forgot I was apart of, and to turn it off I have to go through 6 different screens and turn off 3 options to not get notified when something irrelevant happens on the app. The only reason I keep it is because I use it to log onto other applications and to remember birthdays, which it doesn’t always do. Why is there an option to get reminded of somebodies birthday that has already passed? This conglomerate of a company ruins everything it touches, and with each new app acquisition it continues to ruin others. Do not download this cesspool of an app, if you do your feed will be filed with an endless amount of fake news, bigotry, racism, sexism, and unchecked political ads that only cause more political divide. The dumbest people I’ve ever met have been on this app, it’s very clear from the comment sections of nearly every post, and I can’t help but wonder if it’s because they’ve spent too much time on this foul app."
"I don’t use Facebook to social or communicate with others, only for business purposes such as selling products and offering services. I do not comment on posts or upload pictures. However, today I woke up to a 24 hour block due to “posting content that violated their community standards”. I was unable to comment or post anything. I need to run ads and I also can’t do that either!

Now my business is on pause for 24 hours simply for sleeping in my bed. Waking up to this really ruined my day and caused me a lot of anxiety. Despite the excessive bugs and glitches, this is a horrible platform. I do not ever recommend for personal or business use. Why are you blocking/banning people without any notice or any way to appeal or contact support? How do you expect your users to like your app when you punish them for absolutely no reason? That’s like getting a traffic ticket that doesn’t say what you did wrong. How am I supposed to learn and not do it again? I don’t even post anything or engage with anyone and yet I’m still blocked. Wow. 

No wonder your app has 2 stars."
"Facebook has recently updated a lot of things, yet the quality of every video is so bad when its loading, not even when i have good internet it will do fine! Now the part that concerns me is the unsafe part. You cant report somethings because its not in the list. But if you see children dancing in a inappropriate way, I think its something we can report. Why report just a dance? While we people thinks its normal, there are some pedophiles looking at these videos for sexual purpose. I recently reported a video of two young boys dancing twerking on each other but very sexually. I couldn't find a way to report cause its not nudity. One time also they blocked me for commenting because i was defending myself from a racist person. And that time that they told me they are going to take my profile down if a share videos that are facts, which the video has nothing to do with facts checks, because the video clearly showed how many congress man didn't show up and yet the put the assistentie paper on their desk. I hope Mark Zuckenburg knows what he is doing"
"Facebook used to be a fun way to connect with friends and family but it has become so toxic. The constant banners that Facebook adds on to people’s posts supposedly to “inform” but really are just propaganda only fuels this toxic dumpster fire. Then they delete comments that don’t “meet their standards” and it makes no sense. I had one comment deleted as false information when I posted a comment stating the constitution word for word. This was on a post when someone claimed our current VP could not be Pres because her parents are not natural born US citizens. Anyone with basic knowledge of the constitution knows that post was false. My comment was deleted but the post was not. What idiots are running this website? Another comment was deleted when I made a joke on a picture my husband posted. He found a snake in our backyard, I despise snakes. I joked with a friend that it’s “time to burn the house down.” Any idiot could look at that post and my comment and see that it was clearly a joke and I’m not “inciting violence.” This website and app is such a freaking joke. I would give it zero stars if I could."
"Within the past few weeks friends’ accounts that are longtime active mutual follows (& real time friends) no longer are being reflected in news feed or those active in the active accounts banner.  It fixed with an update and then started again 3 days ago.  Completely unfollowed everyone and refollowed just the few that were an issue and it’s still happening.  Please, address and find a way to not have the system pick & choose who we can & cannot see from our follows that we choose to set up as follows when there hasn’t been any negative interactions between those people.  
Thanks.

Update:  there was an update but this issue has yet to be addressed.  I’ve seen it coming up in other reviews and have verified with others that they are having the same issues.  The algorithms are “hiding” people from seeing their friends’ posts, active statuses, et al, even when both sides are set to following one another.  Please, fix."
"Search doesn't work at all, notifications list (within app, not push notifications) don't work at all, save function isn't there. All of these functions are gone. When I click red notification alert, the notification list doesn't come up at all and there's no way I've found to get around this. Search can literally never find a result, including search for friends' names  Even a search for ""Trump"" found no results on FB. Also, ""stories"" feature, at top of newsfeed page, doesn't work - it's just empty rectangles!  And whenever a foreign language is used in a post, it's not there on my screen (The tipoff it should be there is ""Rate this translation""). 

All this is a disaster as it makes FB mostly unusable on my phone and I just want an older functional version again.  I wonder if it's happening because I'm using an old iOS but they should have blocked it from downloading if that was a limitation.  Now I mostly have to use my laptop for FB - this is the worst app problem I've ever had in 10 years."
"LOVEEE ittt! 😍 #itisthebest #longtimemember #itsamazing 👯‍♀️

Honestly, they couldn’t have made a better social media site to stay in touch with family and friends! I have tried pretty much all of the social media sites out there, and I have to say, this one is BY FAR the absolute BEST. 

However, there are some things that I’d LOVE to see added on/changed. Facebook has already made some ahhmazing changes and “add-ons”. I mean, I really can’t complain but I would love to see some new things (i.e) like.. (1). maybe they could add some blogging to the mobile site. (2). They could allow more than the set limit that they have as far as is many “friends” you can have without exceeding a certain limit. (3). I think it would be REALLY awesome if they could add some “color themes” to choose from for each individual page. (4). I think it would be great if we could choose from a particular set of “FONTS” to type with? Yes, I know there are different types of “apps” to choose from to download on our phones for that- BUT not everyone can read them due to having different types of phones. So yeah, “FONTS” that we can all choose from where everyone could see would be GREAT! 👍🏼

Other than that, Facebook ROCKS! 🤘🏼

"I have now lost all my FB access as I can not be recognized by email or searching to find my account by name- I have circled for two days the HELP CENTER they tell you is the ONLY MEANS OF SUPPORT as they do not offer ANY SUPPORT whatsoever for this app. I tried notifying them in the beginning my account was being messed with as I had messages being posted through messenger Sending out porn spam to my friends, and then the next morning after hours of trying to loop the useless help info which all circles to the same pages of information that DOES NOT HELP if you have NO access!!!!!!! My account is now inaccessible to me. I HAVE TWOOOOOOOO BUSINESS PAGES linked to this profile which I have NO ACCESS TO anymore and NO HELP! How can FB be a multi billion dollar company and have “the best hackers and technical security” and yet HAVE NOOOOO AND I MEAN ABSOLUTELY NOOOOOOOOOOOO HELP to recover a hacked account. Now my businesses suffer as well as all of my pictures and personal info GONE! 

Out of reach! Online there are thousands of complaints of the same thing I’m stating now! WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH FB! This is TERRIBLE AND I CANT BELEIVE I SPENT MONEY WITH YOU FOR MY BUSINESS!"
"I have a warning on my profile from a memory shared back in 2020 that just came around. It won’t let me view the memory and is flagged for bullying. I didn’t share the memory so only I should’ve been able to view it anyway. But since the new update and change to Meta or whatever, the whole website has gone down the gutter. There’s some sort of new AI that determines what posts are and aren’t eligible to post and it’s when certain words are added to a post. God forbid if you want to use FB as a platform for a starter business - the least user friendly I’ve encountered. Censoring every single thing without reading into the context is how we move backwards as a society because we can’t learn from our mistakes if we can’t even see it. Doesn’t actually protect anyone and only encourages ignorance and intolerance. The only reason I haven’t deleted FB yet is because the elderly people in my family use it and it’s the only way (other than a phone call) to keep in touch with them. That’s it. But as soon as another platform comes along, bye bye FB Meta"
"Facebook is becoming a communist FAR LEFT platform. Not only censoring topics that Facebook doesn’t want shared but completely SILENCING anyone that has a different opinion. 

So, Facebook is Nazi Germany of social media! You’re not even allowed to disagree with any narrative Facebook doesn’t approve of first. They’re literally deleting post, deleting comments, removing videos if they don’t go along with the main stream media narrative. This is dangerous! Let’s say hypothetically today they silence people you don’t like or agree with so everything is ok for you now, but what happens when they start silencing something you believe in, what happens when they silence your voice even though you speak from experience on the topic, they’ll silence you because you aren’t the majority. See the problem. Opinions shouldn’t be silenced, we should be allowed to talk topics, and be allowed to share our perspectives-but they’re tryin to make only one voice: The Beast system speaks for all. 

Facebook is a communist run company! Worst thing to happen to social media!!! Communism doesn’t work!"
"Recently back in July of this year, one day i had took the app completely off my phone due to me not using it as much. And i tired to re download the app mid July due to family/friends sending me messages and etc. but I been having trouble signing in on the app. Everytime I go to log in it say “ login error” I’ve tried to reset my password multiple times and cancel the app , take the app completely off my phone and re download it and i even reset my entire phone thinking my phone was the issue but it wasn’t. The Facebook app and the messenger app I can not access to log in. I get the same “login error” message over and over. But here’s the kicker it’s only on my phone. All of my friends/family members who has the Facebook and messenger app I can log in on their phones and bomb it works. Idk what’s going on and why it’s not allowing me to log in on my current phone. My phone is fully updated and I have plenty of storage and space. It’s just something about those two apps. Now any other app I can access and login with no problems. Facebook people help me"
"I used to love Facebook. But then they got too deep into politics... and now they’re extremely biased. I can’t believe the amount of fake fact checking they have and how they ban live videos of people attending events they don’t want other people to see (rallies).  Not only that, but the fact that our information is sold to other big tech companies is just wrong. Facebook is not a fun place to enjoy catching up with friends, it’s a place where they use psychology to make people addicted to make them more money as they sell to advertisers and other companies. It’s a place where people now work hard to create false realities to impress others. It’s a place of judging others and getting thumbs up for it... it’s a place of insecurities and wanting to be liked with the most hearts on a photo. It’s a place that is intentionally aimed to keep people limited, dumbed down and out of control. Because in reality... if you use Facebook or Instagram daily... Facebook controls you. Your phone, your camera, your laptop.... all your information is theirs."
