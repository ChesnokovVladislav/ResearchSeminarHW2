I absolutely adore this app. It keeps me connected with my friends and family at all times. The chat features are amazing. One of the features I love about WhatsApp is the saving a chat message which has the star icon. I use it all the time to save important and special sweet messages from my friends and family. WhatsApp even lets me look at all the saved messages in that conversation under the contact which I really appreciate. WhatsApp settings are very easy to get around with and with no problems. Another feature I love is the Preview feature. When I’m going to a public place where I could possibly forget my phone somewhere and I don’t want my messages to be seen or in another case I want privacy I use that feature. I also like the customizable sound notifications for each contact. I absolutely am grateful for this app!
"What happened to what’s app after the update. It got worse. What about being able to delete what you sent on both sides nit just from my chat, it used to not any more! You said there were improvements? Not at all! Improvements doesn’t mean to take away what worked well for many. improvements is enhancing adding not removing what works. What a disappointment this app fell short! Many feel the same! Security? That probably won’t be secure either anymore! Let’s see what will happen going forward with all the breaches and the  unsecured  and less encryption . I can go on and on. If you say you will improve, then do as you promise!

"I am particularly fascinated with WhatsApp because of its versatility and agility as far as social media platforms are concerned. It takes customer privacy and security into great context and go out of their way to protect that customer information from 3rd parties and hackers. I have never heard of a hack or security breach into WhatsApp security systems. Overall the App has been great and has eased the way the world has connected via talking and sharing digital and graphical data. 

The only downside to WhatsApp is that when you lose your device or are out of storage and uninstall the app, you typically lose all your previous chats and data. I would have been great if WhatsApp had an option for optional storage space for sale, for folk to backup their communication and social media data. 

Thank you"
"What was once a wonderful secure platform is fast becoming a laughingstock ever since it was touched by Facebook. So thoroughly disappointed. Relatives abroad had told me that Facebook is phasing out WhatsApp but demands that we give them all our contact details; I’m not for that. Apparently, In the UK, WhatsApp was given customers until the first week of February before they close an account if the customer refused to except terms to the detriment of customer privacy. Now there is a delay to this change? It’s still going to happen so why the delay? Could it be that this delay is to collect our information anyway without a permission, anyway? I have now started looking for a replacement to WhatsApp. I am sorry to be parting company with you but it isn’t the secure independent platform it once was and the quality has progressively deteriorated. To be honest, if I could opt for zero stars that would be the level at this point. I’ve been trying to speak to others over the platform but I’ve spent more time trying to reconnect or redial and it’s just not worth it.  Another competitor bows out."
"WhatsApp in general is fine. But every photo I take in the app is fuzzy; and more zoomed in than my normal photos app. It’s like they are putting camera in video mode and taking a screenshot. I guess this is part of their cross platform library but still, I wish it would let the camera app use more native and high quality functionality.

Additionally, it’s wayyy too easy to send things to the wrong person. You can’t remove people from “recently contacted” or “frequently contacted” prompts around iOS for sharing. I’m terrified I will send my girlfriends brother something immodest because his name shows above hers even though our chat volumes are way different.

WhatsApp is a globally loved tool but has some pretty strange UX issues given its financial backer and experienced staff. I will continue to use it as most of the world doesn’t have iMessage; but if they did; I don’t think I’d miss the WhatsApp app that much."
"I would like to humbly suggest an update in the name of users who use Bluetooth AirPods. The microphones on these devices are terrible for recording voice memos. People never understand what I say. It would be good if it were like Instagram. On Instagram, when you record a voice message it utilizes the iPhone mic instead of the AirPod mic even when using the AirPods. When I am having a conversation with someone via voice memos on WhatsApp, I have to turn off Bluetooth, then record my voice memo. After I’m done recording I have to turn Bluetooth back on. It goes on and off indefinitely until I am done with my conversation. So with that it would be awesome if we had the option to turn off the Bluetooth/AirPod mic only in a setting or just update it to be like Instagram where it records on the iPhones mic and only plays back on the AirPods. 

Thank you so much!!"
"I really love this app. It's incredible how you can talk with anyone around the world without paying actual money. There’s nothing wrong happening with my version, the camera works well and shoots good photos. There are some things that would make this app the best messaging app. The first one is that when you mute a group chat there should be an option that allows you to mute it forever, same goes with the real-time location. When you create a group, others shouldn’t have the option to kick you from the group, and there should be an option to make someone not be an admin without having to kick the person and adding them again. Also, I really want the GIFs to have their own spot so you don’t need to go to Photos and Videos and then click GIFs. Also, make a DRAWING option. Well, that’s all. Thanks for this amazing app."
"As an  avid user of social internet media , I found WhatsApp is lacking in many convenient features offered in other apps.  I use Facebook when I want to express some thoughts, events etc. But FB Messenger is not efficient in quick text, so I still resort to 20 years old practice in text msg like in Nokia phones. WhatsApp is subservient to the features offered by WeChat.  Understood that WeChat is by Tencent in China, nevertheless the features are amazing. The Moment posting functions are like Facebook  post. The conversation wether individual or in chat groups are more user friendly than WhatsApp. It allows recalling a wrong message sent in mistake. Attaching files and emojis are awesome. My only complain is that once viewed in one device the message cannot be reviewed in an other, which FB allows all history conversation once logged in. 

I lived in America over 47 years. I highly recommend friends to use WeChat for daily contacts over other apps."
"The app is really great and connects me with my contacts all over the world. It makes it easy to stay in touch. You can text and even call for free. Doesn’t get any better than that!
The only thing I would change is how easy it is to call people by accident. It happens all the time. I wish they would hide that button behind the profile page. This is mostly a texting app, do we really need that button on the first page?Even on an iPhone you have to first click the i button from the message page to call someone. It’s smart. 
Another issue is that the app distorts the quality of pics and videos after they are sent. I often receive videos with delayed sound and fuzzy images. I have to ask my contacts to send me those through other apps so I can actually get the proper sound. 
Please fix and it will be the most perfect app!"
"WhatsApp is one of the best messengers, the fastest and most efficient, but I have a problem.
I can not stop showing a call made through the application in the search history (spotligth) of the iphone. it doesn't matter from where you delete the call, not even deleting the contact at all from the iPhone, It always appears the last time you called that contact in the spotlight search if you call it with WhatsApp. 
This phenomenon does not happen with the native application of iPhone calls, deleting them from the history deletes them from everywhere and there is no trace of it in the spotlight search. This little detail does not happen with WhatsApp. I have had personal problems because of it, I hope you know what Iam talking about and solve this. Regards."
"So me and my friend were talking and I put too much emojis I didn’t even get to send I kept copying and pasting u until it makes a long paragraph because I wanted to try something but it just lagged and then I left WhatsApp and went back onto it and clicked on the friend I was texting but it didn’t open. Every time I click onto our chat, it doesn’t open it just lags on her name then I need to get off WhatsApp and on again I also turned off my phone and opened it again and still the same problem. I could open other peoples chat but not me and hers. It does let me go onto her contact info when I long click on her name but when I tried to get back onto our chat it wouldn’t work I even tried to do the chat search and it wouldn’t work. What would only work is the media,links and docs and the starred messages so please try to help me out with getting back onto our chat.❤️"
"recently I've been having some trouble with it on my iPhone X. It freezes once I open it and no matter how long I wait for, it doesn't unfreeze. Force quitting the app, restarting my phone of powering the phone off then
putting it back on after some time doesn't help. sometimes have a few seconds after relaunching it to move around before it freezes again and that It helped me resolve it the first time it happened by deleting over 40 GB of media from chats. Now it's started freezing on launch again and I can't even
successfully delete any media from my WhatsApp to try to fix it. have a lit of free space on my phone by the way, so I'm not sure what the cause is. It happens so suddenly. One moment I'm using it, the
next moment, it won't work no matter what. still see the notifications from messages coming in, but can't do anything about them."
"Sometimes my messages can’t go through on time and it’s takes forever for them to receive it. When I text my friends who own Samsung devices, the message won’t go through even though they’re still online. It usually takes about 3 to 2 minutes for the other person to read my message(s). What really bugs me is that once it shows *last seen today at (time)* the message that I’ve sent is delivered, and it’s would show the double check mark. So the person who I sent a message to would only get it if they exit out the app. Plus, no matter how much messages you send to that person, they will never receive it until they exit out of WhatsApp.

Please fix this issue🙏🏼. It makes it really hard to communicate, even when it’s an emergency."
"I have used WhatsApp for about a year now, and I love it!!!!WhatsApp is an overall Great and Safe social Media!!! It allows me to be able to communicate with friends and family around the world! WhatsApp is a great way to message and talk to your friends and and family virtually! It has satisfied me 100%! I extremely suggest it. One feature that I’m in love with is, the status feature, it allows you to post videos,gifs,pictures about you and what your doing today, and plus to keep it safe, only your contacts or the people you chose can view it!! WhatsApp is amazing! My friends and I enjoy it very much!! It keeps me in touch with everyone! 😊! I 100% recommend anyone to use WhatsApp, it’s completely safe and free!! 🤩🤩

Sincerely,
         Kira Robinson"
I’ve got a lot of problems with my WhatsApp app. First of all why every time i add stories then when I went back and deleted em other people still can see em? Today’s been 3 years since I started using WhatsApp but it still the same why i have to update my WhatsApp app every once in a while? And the main thing I noticed is even when I blocked someone i can read their stories and the can read mine as well sometimes i got very upset and one thing i also noticed is when I’m talking to someone on WhatsApp my background always looks black or blank and it won’t let me do nothing. Please guys do something with this app that will makes everyone happy. I use WhatsApp more than any other apps out here please fix these issues for me. Thank you 🙏🏾
"I’ll suggest that contact should be able to tag people on their status , because sometimes people upload your pictures and you don’t end up seeing it within 24hrs when it disappears ... but if a tag feature is added , I can easily upload a picture and tag whosoever is in it and even though he doesn’t end up viewing all his contact status he will definitely see mine and I get a “thank you”

This happens mostly on birthdays when a lot of people upload a picture of you and you can’t view all contact status to know who and who uploaded your picture so you can thank them... but with this tag feature ... contacts can tag who is in his/her story and the person get to see it ... Thank you"
"I’m overwhelmed to be able to connect to the people that mean the most to me. I had a big lost with 5 family members 2 friends and my dog. Was so lost and alone. A wonderful young man and his brother that worked with my brother in law stopped by to check on me. Then found out my husband passed too. They came to see if I was ok. Well they jumped in and did so much for me. They went to Mexico for their mother’s birthday. They invited me but I wasn’t well enough. So we can communicate and I get checked up on. They have become my family. They would be here ASAP if I needed them. Thank god we are able to keep in touch. I can’t wait to see them as well as keep in touch with their family. I’d be lost without them. I’m grateful to be able to have your service. 
              Thank You, Paulette"
"PLEASE READ I NEED TO KNOW IF THOS IS JUST ON MY PHONE..... So I really love the app, there’s nothing really wrong with it except that, well, idk if it’s just a bug in my phone or if it was the recent update... but when I enter the app it takes a looong time to actually be able to enter the app. Let me explain... when I enter the it’s just few miliseconds till the app randomly kicks me out, and the worst part is that it’s not only once, at least TEN TIMES till I can actually use this app. Sometimes I even have to turn off my phone just to send a message. Since I’m from another country I don’t use the message app, so WhatsApp is the only way to fast communicate with someone. Some people I know also have the same problem so I don’t think it’s just my phone. Please let me know if this is a bug on my phone or it was a problem with the update."
"I’ve been using the WhatsApp since a long time ago, I still believe that the are a lots of things need more improvements, when you chat you can’t go back to the point you need, you should scroll and sometimes it crash & all your efforts will fade away, this should have an option that makes go back to the event you want or by choosing a photo from your media or a scroll option on your chat page.
After saving you personal stickers from other apps on you favorites you cannot save them in categories that you want or create, this also needs some modifications so you can save them in your own categories that make you act faster & easier.
Hope we can see these options when the updates come
Regards to the team & their efforts."
"When IOS updated several months ago, one of the features that was affected on WhatsApp was the option to sync contacts. I called Apple then and they informed me that each app provider must update their security profiles to be compatible with the new IOS. There have been 2 updates of IOS since then and still, WhatsApp hasn’t got with the program. 

Utility of WhatsApp has gone down as I have to research each contact to try to even place a call to them. Numbers that are in my phone book don’t register so it’s difficult to know which contact is which without that extra step in research. Furthermore, I can’t save new numbers directly from WhatsApp to my phone. This is quite frustrating. I have never left a review on this app before and decided that 5-6 months of this is enough. Can you please update your app to resolve this issue with iPhone!"
"There is not enough text space to write down everything I love about this app, nor do I have the time to write it all down!!
Suffice it to say, I wish I could get everyone in my contact list to use this. For work, we have a record of all of our conversations, which in my line of business, this has been a really good thing for us. Also, you can see when the person read the message. Being able to back up conversations to the Cloud has also been useful. One of the things I’m most impressed by the Developors of this app is that they are constantly updating the app with new capabilities.  Like I said, there are several things I could continue to write about how much I love this app. Suffice it to say, it’s one of the best Apps in my phone and I’m a hard critic when I comes App reviews."
"iPhone ex I can't send a picture I can't change anything in the picture I can't write anything in the picture because the frame is a large then I can get the frames bigger the frames of the pictures bigger then the screen please fix this problem because I can't send picture from iPhone X ⬆️ Now it's fixed this is update for this I have other problem sometimes everything applaud when I'm inside the app and I can't make everything move until I push volume up volume down and power to shut down the iPhone this is coming between every week every two weeks inside the app everything is freezing

Hello, WhatsApp does not work with me now and I cannot move anything inside it as long as I am connected to the internet, whether through Wi-Fi or through 4G and it does not move until I close WhatsApp, then close all communications and activate flight mode, then enter, do not move inside the application and do not send to anyone"
"#1. Bring back the hidden archived chats ! It’s for personal security and privacy ! Staying hidden was waaay better, please bring it back and just find another way of notifying the user if there’s a new message from the hidden archive. If it’s not by default at least it should be put in settings where you could activate & personalize user experience. 

#2. Selecting a list from your contacts to broadcast a message to is not an easy task especially for those of us who have lots of contacts list. I think we’ll be way better off if we had the option to “auto / multi” select all (256) contacts at once, rather manually doing it, It gets really boring at times. Also increase the total number of contacts who can receive a broadcast message at a time. (256) ain’t enough. Thanks"
"As the owner of a locksmith company and the manager of operation at Okey Dokey Locksmith, I want to say that WhatsApp is one of the most useful app we use on a daily basic.
This platform of communication allows use to create a secondary network in a secondary level when we put customers on first priority.
For example: if I dial/talk to a technician I use WhatsApp and customer can still call me on the cellphone.
To further explain: if I call tech on the phone it takes 10-15 seconds for the telecom system to connect the call and within this time frame of clicking the dial button to the moment the line is connected, a customer might get to the answering machine.
Highly recommend to all of you business owners to use WhatsApp as a secondary network for your employees if they are interfacing customers over the phone."
Ok whatsapp why are so you put exit when you have no space literally what if yo have no service I literally had no service and then your like oh no space exit what if someone has a problem and needs my help then I fixed that problem and deleted photos but then I noticed when I clicked on camera or mic it says to go to setting to enable it and I never unable it and then it takes me to the setting where it says WhatsApp and it says nothing to enable a camera I search it up and it says to go to  some photo thing so I can turn it on WhatsApp the photos and mic and it shows nothing all it shows is apps that have requested to access to you will appear hear please fix this I did nothing to WhatsApp I like it but this is frustrating
"Whatsapp new private policy is basically sharing all your info to facebook, it wouldn’t be shocking that they were doing it all along without telling us. Money hungry corporations want to sell our information and not value our privacy. That’s why Telegram and Signal has received record numbers of new daily users, we’re all witnessing the death of Whatsapp and the birth of a new messaging app that actually values our privacy.

Since Facebook has bought Whatsapp, Whatsapp has been a app of full controversy but also a app that is lagging behind new innovation, WiFi Calls are laggy even though your WIFI is strong, and fiber internet. Even though your on a 5G+ Coverage and Whatsapp WiFi calling still lags and disconnects. 

Whatsapp needs new updates and new innovation and improve their service and most importantly improve their “encrypted” connection and if they care, our privacy. They won’t do any of it, just move to Telegram or Signal, and these apps are GREAT."
"WhatsApp is an amazing chatting app that conveniently connects you to a broad chat base of your family & loved ones, friends and acquaintances alike at a quick setup without having to generate unique ways to connect with each other. It has a plethora of other cool features like ability to make voice and video calls etc. and now even make payments to each other for a dinner you shared but did not pay for... BUT all this power without the possibility to lock the app or have a password access is a waste of opportunity to complete the offering by WhatsApp. I really feel THEY ARE RATHER LATE. PASSWORD PROTECT OPTION at starting the app window IS MISSING AND should have been there like yesterday ... it’s a simple feature addition but gives many people the safety they want to protect their communication and today communication is everything!"
"I love this app, but 1 thing I wish they would change is their notification system/inability to get calls when I’m on another cal. Sometimes I’ll be on a phone call from my actual phone, and then when I get off the phone an hour later, and if someone from WhatsApp is trying to call me, it’ll say “Missed Video call from____”. To me, it’s annoying how if I’m automatically on a phone call, the WhatsApp video call won’t go through period. WhatsApp should let the video call go through, so even while I’m on my phone during another phone call, and I see someone calling me, I can answer the other. Sometimes it’s important and I need to answer because it’s family from another country, but I never can because WhatsApp automatically tells them I’m on another call, but doesn’t notify me. Fix it. Please. It works with audio calls, why not do this for video calls too?"
"I didn’t doTouch the stars above so if says if it says five that was already there.I love the service up until now I’m not sure what’s going on.

What time I click on WhatsApp it just disappears.  I came to the App Store to see if I need an update but it just says open and when I click on it  is gone!Poof!. I wonder if I was being canceled like Facebook,Twitter and other social media companies cancel  people who disagree with. Their view point. It  happened  for a while until one time I was able to get on there and write a message to let a  family know what was going on and then it happened again.I surely hope that what’s up I have not joined the other social media companies who are the side to control free speech."
"Whatsapp is a great tools for friends, family and businesses.
The continuous improvement of the apps is great too as well. 
So many new features added and so on.
Nevertheless there are other great things that are being taken a way from the apps that need to be reconsidered for great and greater experiences. 
Not sure if it’s a bug that would be fixed or deliberately done.
Few things I noticed are;
1) The inability to fast forward or rewind voice messages.
This is very handy function as sometimes we just need to quickly get a point from a voice message we have previously listens to and so on. 
2) When viewing status that has audio we have the ability to increase the audio by using our phone volume keys and able to set it to the desire volume. But now it’s volume is static once you push the button at the start of the status it added audio that can neither been increased nor decreased. 

Please try to look into this as it’s embarrassing having your phone on highest volume in public places and be unable to adjust it. 

Am using an iPhone 8 Plus incase these issues are only on certain devices. 
Thanks"
"I use it 24/7, it is amazing, works pretty well. I only have one request, please let us be able to disable the camera sound from settings. Just like you can disable the sound it makes when it takes a picture in apps like Snapchat. The only way of getting rid of the noice made by the camera is by turning your ringer off. I use the camera a lot so after a while the sound becomes annoying, leaving me no other choice but to turn my ringer off. Problem is I need the ringer on and it has already happened to me that I miss several important calls or can’t locate my phone when calling because I forget to turn it back on.

It would be lifesaving if you could do that please, I don’t think it’s something complicated. It’s a rather simple request. Other from that, great app"
"This is the most user friendly texting App! 
It is so easy to send messages, videos, phone calls, voice messages, use voice to send texts and stay in touch with other individuals and groups with chats and broadcast lists.  It’s SOO versatile. 

This is the main way of communicating for most countries outside the US.  We lived in Ireland and Panamá for the last 13 years and all those people and the surrounding countries use it.  It’s so wonderful.  We hope the US will catch on soon!! 

We use it for our families, friends, and prayer support groups. The school use it with official and unofficial class chats, staff chats and important school info, including emergency schools messages are sent there as well, because everyone has it! 

I love the search features to find important info and the ability to star favorite texts and photos that I don’t want erased. 

The ability to slide a message or photo over and make a comment on it is brilliant. Copy, pasting and forwarding is so easy too.   As I try to communicate on messages and Facebook, I get frustrated with it’s limitations.  I so prefer WhatsApp!  

Thank you, WhatsApp, for doing a great job!"
"I’ve been using WhatsApp for a number of years now, lately I’ve been having a lot of issues with chat backups, I have them set to backup weekly, but I find myself having to go back in and press the backup now button because it tells me that a connection error occurred and it couldn’t do the backup, now I’ve lost everything, all my chats, pictures, everything all because the stupid backup wouldn’t load fully, it got stuck at around 36mb out of 900, now I know it’s a lot of data but I haven’t had a problem before with large amounts of data backups, I gave it about two or three days to sort itself out, well it didn’t, I had to erase and redownload the app and when I signed back it, it said that I didn’t have any backups, and now I’ve lost everything I had, I am very upset and will consider a different app if this isn’t fixed"
"I never ever write reviews because who has time for them. But I've started to use WhatsApp a few months ago to talk to family and friends in a different country and it's amazing. In fact almost all of my friends (high school) and cousins and older family members use WhatsApp to talk to one another. It's free and there is no dumb ""well the app is free but you have to pay for extra stuff"" it's COMPLETELY FREE. I'm able to see when the text delivered, when the other person saw it and if it's a voice message then when they listened to it. You can also replay voice messages. You can also do stories on it like snapchat which is kinda cool. Over all it's really great, it doesn't have glitches and it isn't slow. I 100% would recommend"
"Our 17 yr old daughter is in Costa Rica right now, traveling w/a group of other high schoolers for a 10 day trip & ‘Whats App’ has kept us in contact(w/Wi Fi of course)so we don’t have to pay outrageous phone fees. The first night we had a little problem trying to talk on a call; kept cutting us off + there was a delay. So then we tried a video call but we only got to ‘see’ her for a few min before the video went black(we could still talk, but apparently the Wi Fi was weak). 
•WE JUST got off of a phone call w/her and for the most part there was no problems, but towards the end our call(about 12min), it was breaking up. 
I would refer the APP to anyone who’s planning on traveling(especially w/kids or teens) so your phone bill doesn’t get jacked up!"
Hey whatsapp it is very important that you guys check out what is going on with this app because recently I’ve been having trouble getting notifications on WhatsApp even calls I can’t even get them when they call me I am getting very tired and I want this issue resolved I just want to let you guys know that when my phone turns off or when the light goes off on the screen and if someone tries to text me or call me does my phone does not ring and I do not receive a notification..... so when I turn on my phone with the home button I really can see the notifications pop up one by one each phone call that I missed pops up as well so what is going on can you please fix this issue please thank you.
"Hello I would recommend this app because it works perfectly. It’s easy to add your contacts. I have been using this for a while now mostly to communicate with relatives but from time to time some close friends. And it’s amazing! Ok so this is for the developer so I have a recommendation could you add a feature on the calls like when your calling somebody could there be a button to where you can share your screen? It would be quite helpful for many people, so it can be very beneficial. Ok, anyways if your thinking of getting this app I totally recommend it. Have a good day! Oh one more thing for the developer this app takes a lot of storage is it possible if you could minimize that? 
Ok thanks bye!"
"WhatsApp has a ridiculous design flaw that needs to be changed immediately. The ""Autodownload photos/videos"" feature on the iPhone has a severely annoying feature in group chats. While I want things downloaded, I DO NOT WANT THEM ADDED TO MY PHOTO LIBRARY. The reason why is that I was in a large public group, and a spammer joined an started posting porn. This was auto-downloaded, added to my photo library, and then auto-transferred to another photo library. As a result, a spammer ended up adding a bunch of porn to my photo library, which was then uploaded to a second backup, and almost ended up with it uploaded to social media. I had to spend hours clearing multiple libraries of this crap, and I still cannot be 100% sure I got everything. 

To be clear, I want to be able to see images that the group posts, and I want to be able to download and add them AT WILL. But the automatic addition to my photo library is an insanely stupid feature I never would want."
"I have been using WhatsApp for few years now ! Love it ! Yet I have a major issue with this STATUS thing there are some statuses that I’m not interested at all in seeing ( irrelevant , boring etc ) but the friends posting them I actually like them and there is not a tool to be able to remove the status and not being able to see it at all ! Now you can mute them but does not block their statuses at all you keep seeing the freaking status even being mute ! Can you developers make an update where the statuses can be block for certain people without having to block completely the person from WhatsApp please? That would be awesome ! Since muting the status does nothing you still be able to see the status !"
"WhatsApp is on a roll! After years of slow development and lack of features, it has improved considerably the last year: Disappearing Messages (7 Days) View Once (disappearing) Archive (to mute groups from disturbing you) Media Upload Quality (option for HD) And more features are incoming: Link Devices, Voice Message improvements and so forth. However, a few more features could improve the app considerably: a /Poll feature for groups so members or work groups can vote. Folders on top of the screen (to differentiate groups or classify them). /Pin more than 3 chats. A new UI to freshen up the app. Otherwise, WhatsApp seems to be on the right track!"
"Hello, I’ve been using WhatsApp for years and it’s great as we all know it, but just today I don’t like the way a message notification appears since I turned off my ‘show preview’. It will usually show the contact name who sent me a message without knowing what he or she sent to me about, but right now I’m having an issue where the notification only shows ‘message’ and it doesn’t tell who sent me a message and of course I don’t know what’s in the message since I turned off the preview from my settings, but I really don’t like what’s going on, if this is an update, please I’m really hoping WhatsApp could do something to make it like what was it before, thank you, I would really appreciate if anything is done."
I had to restore my iPhone for unrelated issues to wattsapp.  When I restored with the Apple support on the line at the time everything looked OK then when I try to get back to WhatsApp I reloaded the chat that was being saved monthly and it went back to a chat three months ago so I’ve lost a lot of important stuff that was happening recently the chats groups that I was connected to have now disappeared and I have to try and figure out how to get back to them .   the system complains about connectivity so I don’t know if it’s a connectivity issue and I have no information from the support what good is a vital form of communication when I can’t get it up and running I feel right now I’m letting people down in some of my groups where I was an important member I’m rather disappointed
"I absolutely love just about everything about your ‎WhatsApp app… And I use it all the time to communicate with my two world traveler daughters (and my son) who are literally spread out around the world.

I only have one single gripe with ‎WhatsApp, and it is the ONLY reason that I am rating it four stars instead of five. I do not understand why, (with all of the resources available to the developers of an app like this that is so popular), you do NOT have an iPad version of this app available!

Everyone in our family who has an iPhone also has an iPad (and there are many), to allow them to see and manage all of our photos and videos in the larger display format. I do not believe that we are particularly unique out there… Please, get the Apple SDK for iPad, and do the work for Pete’s sake!"
"I absolutely love WhatsApp. I’ve been using it for a little bit over 2 years but have known about it for a little longer than that. I first started using it when me and my brother travelled over sees for the first time and wanted to keep in contact with our family back home everyday so they would know we were ok. I immediately fell in love. I love the fact that you can text, call(both voice calls and video chats) and send pictures for free (regardless of where you are in the world), which saves you a lot of money. One of the things I like the most is that you can send a lot of pictures at a time, whereas you have a limit with regular text messages. I will definitely be using WhatsApp for a LONG time😊"
"I tried sending an email to your support but it says invalid address so I’m posting it here. Not a complaint but a suggestion.

It’s really a suggestion I hope you implement. I have stickers that I can’t download packs for one reason or another so they are all saved in my favorites. I would like to be able to have folders inside my favorite so I can organize them the way I like. (Ie: laughing stickers, baby stickers, hearts, islamic greetings, funny, etc.) I have over 500 stickers in my favorite and I’d like to be able to access them in a speedier way please. So like click favorites then inside favorites have folder options that I can drop stickers I want or click on a sticker and have an option to “move to this folder” kind of a thing. ☺️"
"I have not given Whats App permission to access to my contacts. Thus the process of initiating a new chat involves typing out the telephone number of the messaging partner. However, recently, no new chats can be initiated as What’s App keeps giving an error message, after entering the messaging partners number, “number is not on what’s app”- when it clearly IS registered. Tried this on more than one device where I‘m using what’s app (and no contact access granted). I cannot help wondering if this is some sly manner to force users who haven’t granted the app access to contacts, to force them to do so? As I have no plans to grant the App access, if it’s not resolved I’ll be uninstalling the app. Signal is a superior product I’ve been using (from the days of Text Secure!) in any case, just the user base of WA is larger- for the moment anyway. WA- it would be advisable to address this matter, your privacy issues are hard to bat away but this is a total deal breaker."
"The only way to silent a contact video call is put the phone into silent mode!!! Why we must silent the phone for just one app? It rings even when we turn on do not disturb!!! Apple says this is a third party app problem and they can't do anything, so I'm asking you! Please fix it! My phone keeps ringing and the problem is WhatsApp. I can't silent this app calls and the only solution is put the phone in silent mode!!! I don't want to miss calls that are made out of WhatsApp, on the other hand, this app won't be silented in any other circumstances. Even after I mute a contact, there is still ringtone when that contact calls and my phone is not in silent mode !!!!"
In as much as WhatsApp is a great app and I enjoy it please I will that you adjust the chat pattern and I will explain why. Each time I get about 80 messages and I choose to reply in descendant order (from button to the top) I got to realize that after sending a message WhatsApp brings me back to the top which I have to take some time to scroll back down to where I started from instead of just clicking on the next message after the one I replied honestly it’s stressful doing that when you have loads of messages and you want to reply first to the people who sent earlier. Secondly please try as much as possible to include PIN MESSAGES. It helps alot for groups as a good reminder to some relevant Announcement. Also the like button or comment button will be highly appreciated for groups. I HOPE YOU GET TO READ MY MESSAGE AND ADD SOME IMPROVEMENTS WITHOUT FINDING MY WORDS OFFENSIVE. Thank you WhatsApp and I appreciate your app.
"I really enjoy using this app and I've always preferred it over other social networking apps. But there's one thing that really gets me and that is, the ""delete for everyone"" feature; Basically the reason we delete a message is because we don't want the recipient to see the content of that message or we don't want them to know about the message itself at first place. So taking that into account, it doesn't make sense that whatsapp shows the recipient that I deleted a message. 

So it would be amazing if you guys can rethink this feature and make the delete action not visible. 
Thank you in advance for the amazing the future update  🙏🏼🙏🏼"
"I would love to see WhatsApp up status features options  , Now once you and another person have each other number saved we can view each other status which is nice but I think it would be a good idea to have a open status where people can view your updates without having your phone number . Keep the old status option but also add a new option where people can follow you like instagram . ( Overall WhatsApp is great ,it allows billions of people to communicate with their family far in different countries by video or voice without paying for unnecessary   long distance phone plan and phone card ) WhatsApp is the best but there’s room to improve"
"I have been using WhatsApp for years and have never had any issues with it. I’ve really enjoyed the single chat and group chat options, and I appreciate that you can stop a message midway and start listening again where you left off rather than having to always start from the beginning. HOWEVER, I recently purchased an Apple Watch Series 3, and was highly disappointed when I learned that I cannot receive or reply to my WhatsApp messages through it. I use WhatsApp more than any other messaging service, so the fact that they don’t provide an app for the Apple Watch is highly disappointing. I really hope this is something they will reconsider and make changes to quickly. The world is quickly advancing in technology and will only keep moving forward - WhatsApp needs to keep up!"
"My title pretty much says it all. I hold out on downloading this for a long time because I had for some reason imagined it would be really complicated. It simply could not have been easier to figure out. There is nothing to figure out. It is simple and intuitive. And I am thrilled with the announcement that all messages are now encrypted. And free international calling? I had no idea that was a feature. I wish I had known this when I travel to Europe it would have a lemonade it the whole saga of getting international Sim card and figuring out how to connect etcetera. Also, now I will never again have to glitchy Skype with my cousins in Colombia! Highly recommend this app. I guess I did have more to say than the title."
"I was scrolling down the pages in the app and my finger accidentally landed on the stars button for rating What’sApp as I scrolled the page. There’s no way to undo. I rthink I saw one star flash, but it shows three stars, which is at least better, but not enough for What’sApp which does sooo much. Imagine an app that performs so many tasks, avoids so many charges. is not laborious to use, AND is FREE!!!
I’ve had other opportunities to rate and have given it 4 stars. That’s the most stars I give unless the app solves an intractable problem, is the only one, or first/best one to do so, and is perfect. Don’t want to dilute the 5 to preserve its value. When I’ve used more of What’sApp I may rate it a 5. It’s close.
So if you’re wondering who is the dummy who rated What’sApp an odd 3, it’s me. Sorry."
"My app is not working since the last time I updated it, it keeps saying that it needs to recover de chats but when it gets to 10% says it failed, I hit try again and it happens all the times I try. But sometimes when I open the app, it opens all my chats normal, I can even text some people, but then a few moments after it happens all over again and stay stucked at the recover data page.
I use whatsapp to work, I have all my chats and people I need to talk to over there, I can’t erase the app and download it back cause if I do it, I will lose everyting, but at the same time it doesn’t work, I need help from the support to help me fix it please!"
"WhatsApp is a great way for me to keep in touch with my family and friends from around the world. For me, WhatsApp is the go-to app to text my cousins and uncle and aunt in India. The only thing WhatsApp lacks is a WhatsApp iPad app. Other apps like GroupMe have an iPad app. I want to see a WhatsApp iPad app soon. I know that the iPad doesn’t have specific features required for the iPad but there should be a way to have WhatsApp on iPad. I have tried to email the support team about this issue but I got no response! If a WhatsApp iPad app is out of the question, at least optimize WhatsApp for iPad! If there is no WhatsApp iPad app, I may have to delete my account. I would have given it five stars but insisted I have the app a four star rating because of a lack of an iPad app for WhatsApp."
"The app is really good. I use it everyday to contact all of my friends. BUT there is no official whatsapp app available on iPad so I have to use the website on safari and it’s really bothering to have it on my browser and not on an actual regular app just like my mac does so I hope sometime in the near future they could just release an iPad app.

About notifications I would really appreciate if we could change the vibrations like I can on the regular imessages app and not just the tone so I also know who it is from even when my phone is in silent mode.

Now I can’t use 3D touch to preview messages at all because when I use it, it surely works but would ONLY display old read messages and not new unread messages so it is the same as not having the function."
"Not sure if this is a problem of iPhone or WhatsApp but there’s an issue that is so annoying. When reading iPhone notifications if you found a WhatsApp notification it doesn’t show if it was a call or a message (if you have show preview disabled). If you click the notification and it was call, then a callback is immediately placed and you don’t want to do that. There should be a way to show you on the iPhone notification if that WhatsApp notification was a call or a message. Hope somebody can pay attention to this. Thanks

Update. 
Apparently after the latest update the problem is not present."
"I have the latest version of WhatsApp on my iPhone X with the latest iOS 15 as of writing this review. Since the individual chat wallpaper feature was introduced back around December 2020, it has yet to be available on my iPhone X, despite it working properly on my old iPhone 6.

I contacted customer support regarding the issue multiple times but they send me unrelated emails referring to internet connection issues and other random stuff before finally replying many emails later, that this will be fixed in a future update; a few months later, the feature is still missing. Very disappointed.

Other than this issue, the sticker packs are nice when texting and the app overall is quick and responsive. 3/5"
"The Read Receipts and the Last Seen are very LIMITED in their options.

 Here are a couple of features I wish to see in WhatsApp:

LAST SEEN:
- Exceptions: in addition to the original options (Everyone, My Contacts, Nobody), *Exceptions* gives you the option to include or exclude specific contacts from the above settings.
(Telegram app already has this! I don’t know why WhatsApp hasn’t!)

READ RECEIPTS:
- option to turn on/off *read receipts* for INDIVIDUAL contacts. (iMessage already has this option!)

Or similar to the Last Seen options (in telegram):
- “Enable Read Receipts” for: Everyone, My Contacts, Nobody,” with Exceptions!

The purpose of the additional options is:

We all have a variety of contacts. From those who bombard you with messages when they see you were recently online (and/or text you as soon as they see the Read Receipt) to your friends who are more respectful of your space.

We have some contacts from whom we’d rather have more privacy; while others with whom we’d like to have more transparency. With EXCEPTIONS option, you can say goodbye to the “tossing-the-baby-with-the-bath-water” problem."
"WhatsApp is a really awesome and fun app my best friend made me download and I had known about WhatsApp for a while before I got it but for some reason I didn’t really get the point. But now I’m so happy I got WhatsApp! I can send video messages and cute stickers to my bffs and to anyone anywhere around the world for FREE! And it doesn’t need as much as reception. Another thing I enjoy about WhatsApp is that I can finally do group face times!!! And since I have an iPhone 6 it doesn’t work on FaceTime, by that I mean whenever I try group face time it never shows any faces so I need WhatsApp. And with all that being said I can probably say this, I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO MAKE A GROUP CHAT!!! It’s super annoying because I try making group chats and it disappears!!! SO VERY ANNOYING! But that’s the only complaint I have so ya!"
"Great app, been using it over the generations from the s40s. But it would be nice to be able to text permanently in italics or bold ; please give us the ability to have that preference as the italics or bold options are more visually appealing for some of us , also please give us a dark mode; the all white is great but it’s messing the eye up low light conditions, it’d be a big upgrade to get a dark mode. Also video quality on WhatsApp statuses are a mess especially when you have poor internet some low data mode option should be able to load snaps seamlessly at a particular speed. Thanks and I’d be hoping to find some of the fixes in the next update. 😝"
"I wish WhatsApp would actually verify your number and log you back onto your account instead of making a whole new account once you install the app. Exactly how you would do when using the app on a laptop, computer or tablet, just do the same for another phone. The backup didn’t help at all since Samsung is Google Drive and iPhone is iCloud. I’m using my own phone number for WhatsApp so I don’t see why nothing got transferred except for some groups and even then no messages came with those groups either. Really upsetting and I don’t want to pay programs to transfer my WhatsApp data. The app should be more stable than that. This app has nothing to do with the fact that Samsung and Apple don’t want to work together to make transitions easier."
Yes it’s a good app I like the app very easy to use the only bad part for blind people it is hard to navigate voiceover on iPhones yes but it’s a good app very fun to use and everything like that but the only problem is you have to slide through all the apps or messages that you have the chats but basically once you get through that and you find the chat you want or you swipe down to the notification and you were see the notification from the person you want physically have them send you the message first then you go to the notification and you by law you have it from there and then you can get it fixed and going from there it’s a good app I’ll give it five stars actually give a nine stars or 12 stars or 15 it’s just a good app and you know it’s seen every day
"What’s App has been much more useful and valuable than I would have ever imagined, both personally (friends, family) and professionally (working groups, community groups).   I’m still baffled why it’s used by so relatively few people in the United States, but in every other country in the world, it’s the #1 App

For example, in Costa Rica, 94% of all smart phone users have and use What’s App.  

I have made the bold argument that if I had to choose between only having email or only having What’s App,  I would choose What’s App. 

One suggestion/improvement that is so very needed.  I want to be able to send What’s App in the middle of the night when an idea hits me or I want to remind an employee or group about something important say at 2:21 am, however then I feel bad that I am pinging people’s phones on their nightstands in the middle of the night.     From midnight to 6:00 am, I wish I could What’s App and then have it ask me to “deliver now” or deliver say at 7:00 am.   I still get done what I have to, but my employees, colleagues or group members don’t feel the middle of the night intrusion"
"Of course my daughter had to put the application on my iPhone she’s 22yrs. I’m BC ( before Christ )for technology, just not my thing. So my phone rang with the strange ringtone and I push the button and there appears my son, Who I haven’t seen for a year because he’s deployed in Europe in the Army. We had a lot of catching up to do with his career and what I was doing because I’m retired, While we were talking it was just amazing to me to think that he’s halfway around the planet and I’m talking to him live on my iPhone, which was  just freaking bloody unbelievable. So I guess technology does have its place, thank you guys for being out there and connecting families all over the world. Sincerely Michael C Lock Retired MPD #3020,Idaho."
"Due to relocation outside of the US, this app has been my “go to” and main source of communicating with family and friends.  I have tried other apps similar such as Skype, however his app by far is the best in regards to quality and reliability. I rarely have issues with calls and video chats dropping and the messaging is superb. The picture quality while using video is very clear and although my family and I are thousands of miles away, with the use of this app we are still able to feel a sense of home. If you’re considering this app, I say give it a try, just make sure the ppl who you are trying to stay in contact with have the app as well and you’re good to go!"
"I really like that this app allows me to speak to anyone that is available on here without having to worry about paying some huge fee if it is someone overseas. However, there are a few issues I have with this:

1. I am not sure if this is just my connection, but whenever I am in a video or voice call, I often find that it keeps disconnecting me from the call and a lot of times, I cannot hear the other person.

2. The thing that really bothers me when it comes to calling others on here is that if the connection gets screwed up, I will constantly hear this loud beeping sound, which gets very annoying after a while.

What I personally suggest would be to have it where it doesn't beep so loud. Some could say that I am just sensitive to that, but I find that even if the volume is very low, the beeping can be quite loud, while I can barely hear the one I am talking to on the line.

Again the constant disconnecting could be because we are in 2 different countries or it could be my internet speed. The thing that I would really like to see change is definitely removing that assinying beeping sound!"
"My brother is doing an internship abroad and it would cost an arm and a leg to communicate with international data with where he is. This app makes it so much easier for me to communicate with him! The app does an excellent job providing text, call, and video call options. I mostly use the texting, and it’s awesome because it’s encrypted between you and the other person so no third-parties can have access to it. Another note is that my dad doesn’t have any social media and this app has made it so he can talk to my brother without having to use someone else’s social media or using my mom’s, mine, or my little brother’s phone to contact him. All around great app, and I haven’t had any issues with it."
"I love this app yeah cos it’s been basically the commonest app on the app stores with over 7million downloads , I enjoyed the status update option that was introduced too , I’ve been enjoying new features on all updates that’s been brought up until recently when I updated the software And started having issues with searching contacts on my status option , i notices there was another update today so I quickly rushed to get on the latest version and I was surprised and disappointed to see the same problem occurring .. I’m On iOS 14.2 but I don’t think that’s a reason to experience such problems .. please do Something about it as soon as possible ."
"I love this app. Everyone in my family uses it and it’s a great way to connect with people all around the world. I love status updates too. The only suggestion I would make is I think WhatsApp should also add filters for the photo button along with lenses a lot like Snapchat. I think that would be rlly cool and I’d be looking forward to seeing how that would look like.

Ok so I changed this recently. WhatsApp was working just fine until now. Whenever I open WhatsApp, and I’ve tried restarting my phone multiple times, it crashes and the volume button shows up and starts to flash and do really wierd stuff and it blocks my sight and won’t turn off. But whenever I go back to close the app suddenly my screen is working all fine. So obviously it’s a problem with WhatsApp and I’m really unhappy right now so pls change it I really don’t want to stop using it. As soon as u fix this I will make it 5 stars again"
"I looooovvve WhatsApp, it’s my safe space. Not only it help me stay tune with my friends and family which I spend many hours of my day talking to but also with its story feature, it helps me share moments with them as well now the only thing is that I wish they could last longer like I could be able to post longer than 30s videos(Like can we even have a WhatsApp TV 📺 or be able to go live on WhatsApp? Lol). Another thing is that I wish I could log out of my account sometimes instead of deleting the app from my phone if I wanted to be off for a moment. So longer videos and a long out button switch and Boom, this app will be a 5 stars ⭐️ for me"
I love the app okay. I use this app to meet new people all over the world but one thing that i hate well make it two. One of them is the quality of the pictures and videos you post on your story. I upload and share high quality videos and pictures but when you post them to the app it makes everything low quality. It’s so annoying and second is the video duration. 30 seconds it’s too short. I want to oust some fun and funny videos but in order to do that i have to cut it in to pieces which is annoying. WhatApp should make a video last at least 3 minutes. Please read this team WhatsApp I enjoy your app but these two things need to be fixed. Thanks
"My friends tell me that I stuck in 1900’s !!!
Because I hate changes and new things including technology!! My mom lives overseas and she feels very lonely especially after my dad’s death. Many times my cousins were encouraging me to use WhatsApp but I was refusing it. Finally recently when my mom had a heart issue, I was really worried and I wanted to see her through the cell phone. My cousin over the phone, step by step guided me to download this app. It was so easy and now I’m SO GLAD that I tried it. My mom bought a smart phone and now a couple times a day we can talk and see each other for absolutely FREE of charge :) :) :)
I want to thank WhatsApp for letting us to contact each other very easily."
"I love this app it’s how my bf and I were able to communicate while I was away in Mexico since my service wasn’t always great out there. The only thing I don’t like about this app is that if my phone is locked and I have more than one message from the same person, once I reply to one message from the lock screen, all the other messages disappear with it. I’m them forced to open the app completely to be a let to reply to the other messages. I wish we were able to open the message thread on the lock screen like we can with iMessage reply to all the messages and close out without having to unlock the phone and open the app."
"I typically don’t write reviews but I love WhatsApp and I’ve been a user for years.
I would like to see some new features that will make its users extremely happy and productive.
1- A feature to save locations share across the platform so you can later easily retrieve it by label. Ever had to scroll up to look up that location ? Lol 
2- An event creator feature where all your friends can rsvp and it notifies the group of any updates. I have many groups where we organize sport events and night outings an we manually update the list 
3- allow for an account to be link to email so if you get a new number you can retrieve your old account. This one is self explanatory and everyone is asking for it"
"For days now I can’t use my app properly as before. When calls are connected, before I can go back to messages and send and later return by tapping the dial button on top left of screen, Now I can’t do that anymore. The moment I try it I can’t return to call to either mute, use speaker or to add a new caller. Secondly when on a call I can’t add a third party to the call, the search won’t prompt the keyboard to type in names as usual… thirdly I don’t see when some calls come by this time, I will have to delete screen and redial again.. this frustrating , what do I do please? Plus right now I. can’t even update the WhatsApp… Thanks"
For some time now I didn’t understand why my data kept running so fast in a short time I’ll have no data left and I have an iPhone XS Max. But I did a few digging on the app only to realize that my Whatsapp backup was on which is fine but after turning off the auto backup I still see it backing up anyway wether it’s on data or WiFi and it’s frustrating because I don’t intent to backup when I don’t want to because it runs off my data and WiFi plan so I’ll be glad if y’all can fix this please and it’ll be cool if y’all can even have a pause option so I can pause it when I feel like to save me some data and continue when I have enough
"I feel extremely disappointed about this app (WhatsApp) right now. I have been using this app for a very long time and I must say that I was really satisfied with everything about the app. However, and unfortunately, my five year old son deleted the app from my phone and when I tried to re-download the app again onto my phone, I can’t retrieve my chat history. Unfortunately this means that I lost all of my very important videos, conversations, pictures.... EVERYTHING. And, most importantly I lost all the conversations/videos/pictures of my mother in law who passed away from COVID-19. I feel heartbroken because I really loved her and now I have nothing left of her, thanks to WhatsApp. 

Note: I did try all the recommendations provided by the app’s website and other users to try to fix the problem. No luck! 

I don’t think I’ll be using this app again."
"I run a legitimate business since 2007. I have always been very correct towards everyone. Even the most annoying clients. And than there are clients who do not show up, when you leave them a simple reply to please next time leave a message so to not keep me waiting they instead of apologizing block/report you. I have read the terms of service numerous times and never found what i could have done wrong to be “rewarded” a ban. After having sent a message to whatsapp support they out right tell you that people have complained about me. Which is a lie. Whatsapp support doesn't even do proper research to whether the ban is supported or not. Small business often rely on whatsapp for contact towards clients. I could have just gotten another number and reactivated whatsapp. Yet if you have been using the same number since 2007 that can be very annoying. Do better research before banning someone!!!"
"Needless to point the good size, who does't use whatsapp to connect with friends and family? What's missing huge time? Auto-delete media by chat! For iphone users like me, not being able to auto-delete media after a day or so the media was seen or auto-archive them to google photos, for instance, is the most annoying thing I have to manually do regularly in my phone. The only part taking advantage of this lack of functionality is Apple by selling more cloud subscriptions. People will eventually give up and subscribe to apple cloud for more space. PLEASE, enable the auto-delete/auto-archive configuration!! This is an inevitable upgrade to keep the app alive long-term. Even teenagers may start using the app when that happens! This is a win-win-win situation!!

2nd suggestion: Add a speaker versus iphone play button to listen to voice messages."
"WhatsApp banned my number for no reason at all and will not answer me. I use this app to talk to my friends and family in Isreal and other countries from over here in the US. I loved this app but now I’m mad and confused on why I’m banned. Emailed and got an auto response that began with “ email back if you believe this was a mistake and we will look into it “ that SAME ended in “ responses to this email thread will be ignored “ .  I don’t understand. I emailed three times after and now I’m not getting any answers at all. Leaving this review and a message everywhere trying to just get my account back, there are pictures in group chats i don’t have now and it’s all screwed"
"I’ve never had any issues with WhatsApp until today. A person hacked my friend’s account and posing as them managed to hack and takeover my WhatsApp account. In a matter of minutes they logged me out of my device and started contacting the majority of my contacts and asking them for money. I’ve had no way to override this and get back into my account or even deactivate it just so they stop reaching out to my contacts. I also haven’t been able to find any way to contact a live customer service agent to help me with my problem. If it wasn’t for the fact that I texted every single one of my contacts through phone messages, more people could have fallen for it. Not only did it invade my privacy but that of my friends and acquaintances who never consented to this. Very disappointed with the lack of safety & communication with the company."
"WhatsApp rocks!!! But kindly, please update the app so that for when someone uploads/shares a high quality (HD or 4K) picture or video on their status, it doesn’t come up low quality—ruining the picture/video one is trying to share. I personally spent $1200 on an iPhone 11 Pro Max just to be able to share with my friends the amazing pictures I am taking, but unfortunately WhatsApp is letting me down on that. I am always up to date with the latest version for both WhatsApp and Apple, so I don’t think it has to do with any of that. Kindly, please consider to allow high quality or 4K picture/video sharing for your future update. Thank you!!"
"WhatsApp here in Chile is pivotal to almost everyday life. Not only to chat with friends but to send exact locations to others, such as a couple of years ago when we had a car accident and our car flew through the air and we did not know where we were. It is a great way to send voice messages and even to talk with friends all over the world. 

A month ago I was spammed with “good morning” greetings. This happened to me three weeks before and I uninstalled the program and re-installed again. I thought I was in the clear but I am back to these same annoying spam greetings that show I have a virus. At the moment I seem to be clear of that."
"Oh my gosh. Thank you thank you thank you for adding the function that prevents having to hold ones thumb down to record a voice message! This is the best ever. My girlfriend is currently living in Germany, and I am in Santa Barbara, CA, so we have depended hugely on the voice message feature. That said, we often lost our messages >5 minutes in due to a slight wrong gesture of the thumb. On top of that, our thumbs were constantly sore (sounds crazy, but 15 minutes of keeping your thumb pressed in one spot is rough). I have yet to find out if this update also prevents messages from getting deleted if someone calls during the recording, but am definitely crossing my fingers. Nice work!"
I love Whatsapp and it is very user friendly. I use to for personal and work purpose. And really helps in my day to day activities at work. Just one suggestion some times in a group chat we want to avoid a particular individual from some conversation and as a result we end up creating a new group each time and that group is never used again after that conversation. Why don’t you create a option in Whatsapp group where you can create a conversation subgroup and select who should be involved in it from the group and once the topic is discussed the conversation subgroup can be closed. This helps a lot of user in personal and business purposes. Just a suggestion and I believe it’s do able.
"Thanks WhatsApp for providing a free and reliable means of keeping in touch with family and friends all the time. I can’t imagine how I would have been able to do so otherwise. While traveling globally, I am able to share and receive updates and messages from my love ones all the time. You have truly revolutionize communication by making it attainable for everyone. I think I can safely say that it’s because of you why Verizon and all the other networks have made texting unlimited and part of their pricing. If I should give an award to the number one most reliable App for communication, it would definitely be WhatsApp."
"WhatsApp needs a serious rewrite to be viable on iOS. Right now, it commands so much of the phone’s RAM that other apps in the background will “reset” to their default state when using WhatsApp. This is because iOS aggressively manages memory and because WhatsApp uses so much memory, iOS will de-allocate memory being used by apps in the background. This is pretty sucky because it means that I lose my place when reading a news article and leave the app for a few seconds to check my messages. To the engineers: for the love of god find a way to make your app more memory efficient.

“Please update the app to use whatsapp” more like delete whatshapp. Disgusting. You force users to update to use your app? Just admit your engineers have no talent and can’t push updates without breaking the entire app forcing your to mandate your users update the app to use it."
"It’s nearly impossible to connect on video chat on this app because there is NO SOUND OR NOTIFICATION when someone is calling. I’ve checked with my family and they have experienced the same. I could be sitting right next to my phone and have no idea someone is trying to call me, because it just sits silent and dark. The only time I can tell someone is calling is if I am already in the app and on a call. I’ve looked in all the settings, and there is only an option to add, remove or change sounds for messages, not for calls. When someone is calling me on voice or video, I expect my phone to ring. Please add this or fix whatever bug seems to be disabling any sounds or notifications for calls."
"Generally, I like the app. The chat features are really good. However, some of the ancillary features could use further refinement. It’s way to easy to accidentally call someone. Would like a confirmation box before it tries to call out. I’d also like the ability to disable making or receiving WhatsApp calls when not on WiFi. Also, would like them to get rid of the stories-style status feature and go back fully to the old statuses and bring back the favorites list. I don’t appreciate the periodic prompts for setting notifications and the two-factor key reminders are likewise irritating. What other app does that? Seriously, this is really annoying."
"I’ve been using ‎WhatsApp for so many years now. Having friends and family in Europe, México, Central America, India, Iceland, Alaska, and with myself living in the states, WhatsApp successfully connects us all and ever so seamlessly.

One quip I have about this app is that although you can change the background wallpaper on the display between WhatsApp's included styles, solid color choices or personal pictures of your own, there is *-no_way-* you can change the font, it's color nor the bubble color behind what you’re writing.  

After all these years, I'm still irked by not having the freedom of creating and affixing my own style-stamp for chats.  That 'creative freedom', as an option, is as fundementally necessary to express myself as is the message it contains. 

Another vein of increasing public necessity is encryption for video, chat, calls, etcetera. 

Both suggestions are an easy addition.

Oh. And wouldn't it be just lovely for WhatsApp to stop its attempts to railroad me into braiding my contact list in together with it?

If I'd wanted to share my personal information I'd have shared my passwords, too. It's the same thing."
"I like this app and will continue to use it, but there is no way to archive chats and leave them there. I am in a 25 person family group chat (which of course I can’t leave because it will tell everyone) and it’s pretty constantly going, so I “mute” the chat and it doesn’t pop up notifications, but as soon as I open the app I see it at the top of my chat list with a little blue circle of 1,000,000 new messages. I select “archive” and it HALLELUJAH goes away, but THEN (two minutes later) someone sends another message and it pops to the top again... PLEEEEEEEEASE, pretty please with a cherry on top, make a way for me to mute and archive chats that I can control and decide when I want to start seeing them at the top of my chats list again... Please. It would be a life saver."
"This app has got to be the oldest if not one of the oldest message/phone calls/video calls apps that allows you to perform all above mentioned communication methods via WiFi. 
A huge perk is that you may do this in both inside and outside your country cellular limits as long as you are connected to WiFi. 
There is no unlimited usage in all forms of travel. It varies if you are on a cruise for example, or if you are on a specific travel package when you fly outside of the country- in which the responsibility lies between you and your service provider, not WhatsApp. 
This is a fantastic app. Easy to use and straight to the point. 
Thanks WhatsApp!!!"
"Not just with this app, but I’ve been seeing this now for a time with a bunch of apps. Another update comes; then another update exex and it is the (same) update. What is that now? I mean it’s the same exact update sometimes even more than 3 times. 

Hello to you all and peace. If someone cares to explain why this is happening; great. I’m already use to not getting any replies from any developers and I’ve been writing reviews for decades. Just the other day I received my very first reply from a developer and there wasn’t much to the response. They just said: sorry for any inconvenience, we’ll look to pass down your message to whoever it was they said they were gonna pass it to. I forgot."
"My WhatsApp was hacked and hijacked more than 24hours ago. It’s been used by another person who has access to all my data and is using my identity to scam my contacts and has pretended to be me to hack into several of my friends accounts too. 
During this time I’ve been trying through as many means as I can think of to get someone useful at WhatsApp to listen to my story and deactivate my account.
You would think this would be a priority of theirs but I’m afraid most of my messages have gone unanswered and the only person who has responded has simply cut and paste scripted responses to me without actually helping or doing anything.
It’s a disaster, I’ve had to go to the police,  I’m having to try to spread the word via as many different means as I can think of to get people to realize the other person isn’t me. And it could be stopped by WhatsApp but I can’t get help."
"On behalf of my neighbors and me, I would like to sincerely thank the WhatsApp crew for a quality service that helped us help our flooded neighbors after Hurricane Harvey! WhatsApp worked when all other forms of contact would not work after the hurricane. We were able to create groups to communicate dire information quickly, efficiently, and without interruption. This allowed us to rescue neighbors, get medical help from neighbors who are part of the medical community when 911 was not working, and then organize volunteer work crews to start checking in on elderly neighbors and finally create volunteer remediation crews. WhatsApp, you are exemplary! Thank you, thank you! Elizabeth SW Houston Texas"
"I been using WhatsApp since 2012 it’s quite useful. Recently I was trying to hide my profile photo from selected contacts in my contact list but there is no such kind of option, I can not delete those contacts and I can not share my personal information with them as well. One of my friend faced few problems because of this privacy issue, she used to get calls from her nerd boss every time she update profile photo. She can not delete the contact and she don’t like to share  personal information as well. We need such kind of option for Profile photo, Last seen and About.

Thank you 
Sana"
Why is not a good experience I had a phone that I had was with a different number was not this new phone I have and I have my people on that on WhatsApp with that other phone I had with a different number and I can’t get my contacts from that that iPhone anymore and I can talk to the person I was talking to chatting with because what’s up girl never did what they did they never did anything for me to get my contacts on this new phone unfortunately I do you spell my phone and I do not have the contacts of the other phone from ‎WhatsApp I needed him but what’s up did not do that for me when I asked it was a horrible and still is horrible because I still can I get my contacts from ‎WhatsApp and they still haven’t done anything it’s a bad service and it’s a bad thing I like it but they haven’t done anything for me when I needed it
"There was an update that came out a while back that currently causes for the voice notes to stop your music even after you finish listening to the voice note, at least for iPhones. I’m not sure about androids. Before when you would listen to a voice note and was listening to music beforehand it would pause the music, play the voice note and then play the music back, but with the current update it no longer does that and it’s frustrating. I truly love this app because this is how I communicate with my fiancé and family from back home. I would greatly appreciate it if you guys consider fixing this tiny issue. Thank you in advance!"
I changed my number for the second fine and I’m still getting spam messAges some are even gory and death threats from spam numbers. How does whattsapp allow this? You need to seriously make this app safer to use. If someone doesn’t have me in their contact and I have no idea who they are. How are they allowed to message and spam me with nonsense? You guys should be ashamed with the lack of security updates on this app. That’s what you should concentrate on next. Making sure no one gets spam. Figure it out please. Or are you guys not smart enough or you just don’t care? So sad that this is still happening. So today I send a message an audio message and randomly some Spanish music plays in the audio. The weird thing is that I had no music playing in my car and my windows were up. The song just played and disappeared. How weird is that?
"WhatsApp I think is the best social app to chat with friends, family and everyone else. And so far I can’t complain about anything. Just there is one thing that some people might enjoy, I know I would. Is if you could choose which people could view your profile photo. Because maybe if you put a profile photo up, certain people that don’t like you, may view it and message you about it saying nasty things.. or you may just want to keep your life private from those who are in your contacts but Arnt exactly a part of something you’d put on your profile photo. 

Otherwise everything else is perfect!"
I love WhatsApp! I’ve used it several times to communicate with other friends that don’t own any other social media like Snapchat or Instagram. However for the friends that do not own iPhones neither I like to feel like we are still texting over iMessage. I know many other apps with this feature but not quite as clean as WhatsApp. The feature I am hinting at is the ability to change the chat bubble color. The light green does sometimes get boring or make me think of an older app off the iPod from way back when. If we had the ability to change the color of the chat bubble color I could change the color anytime I wanted and wouldn’t get bored and eventually overtime ask the people I’m texting to switch to an alternative app.
"Hi! I really love whatsapp and use it daily, but what would make this app absolutely perfect is if it had an update where you can get your deleted/cleared chats back. I cleared a chat with one of my closest friends/a guy I really loved. I cleared it because I felt bad, because my friend had a crush on him and I didn’t want her to misunderstand. In the end she got a boyfriend, and I can’t get the cleared chats back. Please, is there any sort of way to get them back? Or are they really gone forever? Those chats made me the happiest, I really, really would want them back more than anything. I regret deleting it. Please help!! I’m truly begging you. :("
"First I’d like to say I love this app. Best app out there for communicating with family friends and friends on the other side of the world.
Now the downside. Being a voiceover user on Apple, I wish there was an easy way to lock the record button. Sometimes holding your thumb there after a long time becomes a problem and you relax your finger or flex it or something, and then there goes your message that you haven’t completed yet.
If there was some sort of magic That a voiceover user could do like a two finger double tap on the screen that might be a solution. I’m not sure. Wish we could resolve this issue. Otherwise again this app is fantastic."
"I use WhatsApp because my friends all have different phones and standard messaging does not work. I much prefer using WhatsApp. You can reply to messages, star messages, and reply privately. Stickers make the use of the app super fun especially if you make your own stickers (which you can do with a separate app). I have joined groups (through shared links) with international people and messaging has been smooth and easy. The story feature acts like Instagram stories so my friends and I can see what we are up to! 10/10 recommend for ANY user of ANY phone type."
Love the app and all of it's features! Been using it over a decade. Would like to request the developer to create an option where you can select who can see your profile picture. Just like there is an option to select who can see your status. Because I have to delete contacts from my phone so that they don't see my profile picture. I wish that there would be an option on whatsapp where I can choose people from my contacts who can see my picture without having to delete anyone from my contact list.
"I have been using a new phone for 2 months now. Since then, I can’t log in to WhatsApp. I tried to put my SIM card to my former phone, but WhatsApp doesn’t allow me to log in anymore neither. Since then, I’ve been using SMS and Messenger, but I’m thinking of downloading another app like Signal. It’s very annoying because I was using WhatsApp for many different reasons before. I contacted their customer service twice, but they were enable to tell me why it’s not working and they didn’t seem to care much. They were never rude or anything, quite the opposite, but they had no solution. It seems unbelievable for a company as big as WhatsApp to have some “beginner” issues and not being able/willing to fix them. Overall, I liked the app but I’m very disappointed and I’m going to move on another app."
"This is the greediest app on the planet!
I am constantly having to delete other apps, pics ect. to make space for it. When it randomly does “fill up”(I still have enough space to use other apps and take pictures) it doesn’t tell you till you try and open it!!!! Then it tells you to delete stuff to make space to see the new messages it never told you about and closes right away! Not allowing you to delete anything off of whatsapp until you’ve cleared other data you care about to make space for this behemoth of a Gigabyte Gobbler. Worst App ever in terms of storage space, europeans need to get regular texting. These programmers for this app also want to devour your data so they require you to delete things you care about instead of deleting “their” data. Makes me sick on how poorly this app has been designed."
I’ve been using this app for a long time and have had minor issues like messages not showing up for me or me sending messages and the other person not receiving some them. But yesterday was the worst. I updated whatsapp and when it was done updating I tried to open the app but instead it crashed and took me to the Home Screen. I noticed that WhatsApp had somehow been uninstalled which makes no sense because all I did was update it. I looked for it everywhere but it seems like it was completely erased from my phone. So I reinstalled it but none of my iCloud chats were saved. Even though I backed them up daily and I have plenty of space left. For some reason none of the chats were saved so I couldn’t restore anything. I had a lot of information that I need in one of those chats and now that info is gone forever.
"I love this app! It’s very easy to learn and easy to use. But, when I’m calling someone, it always glitches. When I call someone and try to do something on my phone as well it always shuts off my phone for a second then comes back on to the call screen. It’s been happening to me with another app too. So I thought it was just my phone at first. But then, on other apps I use, it doesn’t crash like that. So, I thought it was not my phone. It’s always frustrating when I am texting someone else a photo while in a call with someone and I get sent back to the call screen. Please fix this. I really like and enjoy the app so I was kinda bummed that the app kept crashing. Keep on doing great work!"
"So I've always used WhatsApp as my primary form of communication, and I've never had any problems with it until today. When using broadcast lists, the recipients can't tell that the message was sent to a broadcast. I really like the broadcast list rather than creating a group because on a group everybody gets every reply, which is usually unnecessary. But when I use a broadcast list I get a lot of messages asking if I meant to send to a group. It's not a big deal at all so I still give the app five stars. Just something to keep in mind for future updates. I also really like that WhatsApp now has automatic playthrough."
"I would not be able to see my doctor, nor would they be able to assess me physically visually, over the phone if not for this app. It works wonderfully. I have had at least 20 appointments using this app with no glitches at all. If a doctor needs to see something you just point your camera lens at the part of the body he needs to see. He will let you know what to do from there. It’s a beautiful tour to keep us that are not fortunate enough to be in perfect physical health still able to adequate one on one health care. Highly recommend🙃❤️"
"This app works great for the most part. I like the feel of using iMessage with my friends who don’t own iPhones. 

My biggest issue right now is that, since the last update, the message input bar will appear in the middle of the screen, sometimes covering the most recent messages with empty space or my keyboard and I can’t scroll down any farther.

I think this app would benefit from an option to not automatically save pictures, taken and sent from WhatsApp, to the camera roll. For the most part, if I take a picture specifically to send to someone and it’s not a picture I took outside of the app, it’s something not important enough to waste the space on my phone."
I really love the voice text feature. Being able to fast forward the message to the middle or the end is really helpful and saves me time. And you can also delete a message if you sent it before the persons opened it. That’s an amazing feature! Also what’s better about the WhatsApp is when you’re recording an audio message and someone calls in you don’t lose the entire message. When using my iPhone audio text messaging I lose the entire message if somebody calls in or if my battery is at a low percentage. So grateful to have WhatsApp on my phone. Thank U thank U thank U for creating it!
"This is hands down the best app they have ever come up with. The level of mobility and peace this app has given me has been life changing. You can go to a new city and just from there find anything you need and how to get there-there’s no struggle at all. It’s really simple and easy. Also I’ve never gotten lost using this app. 

The best part is you can save places you’d like to visit and then later on, click them and find your way. So it’s great for travel on vacation. I highly, highly recommend this app- it will help you discover new ways of getting places and new places. It’s very safe and great for teens as well. 5 stars"
"Please add image captions (text accompanying a sent image message) to chat exports. I’ve reported this issue many times and it never seems to go anywhere.

Like many others have said, there are many issues with customer support. The first response to any query is automated and says to check the FAQs and reply if still not answered. The second response, if any, is unrelated to the query, and therefore as useless as the first response. The third response is nonexistent; WhatsApp support never sends more than one response after the automated message. It follows that you will never get an answer to your query nor any indication that your feedback or bug report will be forwarded to the appropriate team. In conclusion, WhatsApp customer support is completely useless and is just an extra cost for WhatsApp and hindering its development. Needs a major overhaul."
"I love WhatsApp and all it’s functions. It is one of the apps I use the most but one thing that really bum me out is the fact that they haven’t innovated or maintained up to date with technology. The two things that will make this app my favorite is a way to make polls in group chats. Imagine being able to know who is going to the event by just clicking “Assisting” or “Not going”. Imagine being able to decide which photo to upload to Instagram by just letting people choose the one they prefer or even tell you which shoes to buy. The other thing that would improve the app would be Apple Watch compatibility. Being able to tell Siri to send a message right from your wrist or even respond whenever you want and not just when they send a message to you. 

Thanks,"
"I use this app to help people who are fighting mysterious chronic illnesses and am hampered by the fact that I can only have up to 256 people in a group.  Is this an arbitrary limit or is there a reason for this?  A competitor allows up to 200,000 people in one group and I honestly do not want to change platforms.

Also WhatsApp has been very buggy lately.  People’s phones not ringing (after confirming they were not on Do Not Disturb mode or in silent mode or muted), call failures, and not being able to add people to calls even though the limit of 8 wasn’t reached.

I like this app a lot and use it daily, but at some point I will have to change platforms if these issues aren’t resolved soon."
"This app is great especially the calling part of it.
It has revolutionized the app calling as a new way of reaching friends without a hassle as is the case with other app calling types.
Many at times when I get call from friends on other apps & we seem to be having connection problems even with full wifi, they would ask, ""don't u have what's app? Why not use that! It's clearer & no interruptions"".
I want to suggest that the developers should put in a feature that will allow administrators to delete messages and videos from reaching all persons that are considered unacceptable.
Thanks & continue to improve."
"With the latest iPhone update I can no longer click out of WhatsApp and hear the audios continue to play. It cuts them. This was a huge perk that everyone I knew as well as myself raved over as it allowed multi tasking while on phone. Another thing WhatsApp has never had and sorely lacks is that there is no option or ability (as there is on every other app and other messaging software or app such as Skype), to be offline or invisible. For those of us with many chats and many friends on WhatsApp there’s no ability to be invisible while on and anyone may say you and contact. Yes you can turn last seen off but you will still show as online when checking messages. This is my largest complaint about the app from a many year user."
So I tried to retrieve my messages and that didn’t work. I tried chat back up and that didn’t work. I didn’t delete any messages yet somehow when I put my phone number and do restore it won’t let me see my messages. It says I have zero messages which is really weird. When I texted more than one person. I don’t understand how this app restores messages yet it won’t do that for me. I have reinstalled this app and loaded this app and yet when I turn on notifications for this app it still doesn’t seem to be working for me. I don’t understand.
"I love this app, but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE provide the options to turn off the “online” or “typing” status within message chats! Sometimes I just want to be catching up on messages and I don’t have the energy to have full on conversations with people! As soon as I’m on the app so many people start messaging me. I want to be able to respond to them when I feel ready and not feel guilty about ignoring their messages. My contacts knowing when I’m online makes this so much harder to do. This would be a big benefit for myself and so many people who complain about this, and would be a big plus for mental health. Thank you!"
I never had an issue with my WhatsApp app but for the first time having a huge issue. I have deleted the app about 5 to 6 times and every time I do it I set everything up as normal but when says to restore it will go up to 99% then boots me out and I get a message sorry wasn’t able to restore your chat history and to delete it the app and re install it. I can get as far viewing my chats I can be in the middle of writing to someone and I will get booted out. When I go back in my WhatsApp I get a message to restore my chat history and this will go in circles can someone help me solve my problem.
"Hello creators. WhatsApp is an amazing app. I’ve had it for a couple years now, and I’ve had a lot of fun with it. Ever since I downloaded this app, I’ve been texting and calling like crazy 😂. You are able to change the contacts name. I like that you can make a group chat with maximum 256 contacts. It’s amazing. But one thing: you know when a contact puts a new status, because of the blue dot that appears in the corner, but I think that there should be a notification like when you receive a message, this way you can know even if you have your phone off. Thank you! Other than that, this app is amazing."
"This app is so cool u can also hav 4 people on the call and family and friends can call even if u don’t have an iPhone just downloaded WhatsApp it is amazing and also u can make group chat so u can text everyone at the same time who ever u want in the group also u can name the group and put a picture and also u can add how many people u want to add to your group chat because it is a fun app and also u can see who saw your staues and when a person puts a new staues u will get a Notification so download WhatsApp and have fun with it and Text your family and friends who ever u want on WhatsApp have a good day

Sincerely 
Jayleen"
"You may as well have already taken millions of steps, almost moving around the world without knowing, but what if you knew?! Sweatcoin does it; and with its many motivational benefits, and intriguing interface, I’ve found myself loving it right off the bat, and also began setting personal goals to reach a certain amount of steps per day. Sweatcoin is pushing forward a healthy and rewarding mentality, and even if I don’t bother to use my coins, simply volunteering or donating to its highlighted charity projects is brilliant. I believe the app has more to offer and am very excited to know, and move more! There’s nothing to not like, but yet I leave the final star for the creators and future additions to the app!!"
Im sooooo very lonely in USA and I'm very poor to pay normal international calls. God bless who invented and keep and offer us free this site cause I can talk with friends and family and do not feel soooooo lonely here.  I love it. It IS free.  Now with hurricanes and rumors of wars my family is terrorized but I can send áudios and relax them  This is a blessed way of communication please keep like this please  no charges for poor people like me I want Go back Brasil as I can't be successful here but I haven't enough cash but at least I can communicate everyday with my people  god bless USA! I love everybody here and I ll never forget how wonderful this country is !!!!! The land of brave really ❤️💕
"This app makes communication so easy and economical almost anywhere. I really appreciate it!

Several glitches have recently been fixed as well. Thanks for that!

One persistent glitch that has not been effectively addressed is that no matter how I configure the notifications, whenever I receive a WhatsApp message now, it just pops up right in the center of my screen instead of at the top, as I had set it up to do. This gets in the way of anything I may be doing, like streaming a show, or using another app.

Interestingly, after the latest update, my messages started appearing as a banner at the top of the screen - as they once used to do - and they lingered there (as I also set them up to do) but out of the way. So I thought the problem had finally been fixed. However, after an hour or two, the WhatsApp messages I received went right back to popping up right in the center of my screen; obstructing everything.

PLEASE fix this issue once and for all because it’s been a while. Meanwhile, 4 ⭐️’s for a great program!"
"I would like to have the following features added to WhatsApp:
1- Filter by Read, Unread, 
2- Filter by Groups or not-Groups. Meaning if I want to see group chats or chats from individuals.
3- Ability to classify chats and assign chats to to each class. For example, I can define a “Work” class , a “Family” class  and  “entertainment” class  etc. Then I can tag my children and my wife under the Family class, my work colleagues under my Work class and some other chats that are general under Entertainment class. Then I can choose to see only chats from any particular class."
"Dear developer,
I have no complain regarding the app.
It is one of the best app in the world.
One thing I should mention that after searching a new number in the contacts if you just tap on any part of the contact it directly goes for call. I think sometimes it’s embarrassing that may be you are not sure that the saved number is actually to whom you want to call. So I think I its like normal contacts app that after tapping we will be able to see the number then after confirmation we cam proceed with the final call.
Regards ABIR0310"
"WhatsApp is a great app. Everything from the custom wallpaper, to the clear voice messages. This app is close to perfect in my opinion. There are a few disadvantages here and there but nothing that can’t be solved in a matter of time. First, video call. It bugs me that you can only call four people at a time. My friends and I always video call each other especially in times like these. However, one person or two will always be left out because of this limit. It will be great if you can call more than four people. I hope to see some changes soon and my suggestions put into place.✌️"
"I have been using this app for quiet some time now. I use it to talk to my friends, family, basically with a lot of people. One thing that I don’t like is that when someone is typing it isn’t shown at the bottom of the text but at the top (where the profile picture and name is) and it is very irritating to have to raise your eyes up tu see if someone is typing or not and it would be very helpful if they could put the typing thing at the bottom like how most of the apps have it. In general this app is amazing and really simple to use, and I will continue to use it."
"This app is great! I highly recommend this app for anyone who has trouble contacting people. I have an iPhone and the rest of my family has androids and so I am unable to text them which is a big problem. My great aunt introduced me to this app back when it wasn’t a problem. Now that it is, I’ve convinced my family to get WhatsApp and it’s a great tool. THOUGH THIS APP IS GREAT, one thing to keep in mind is that if someone sends you a picture it automatically saves to your phone and you have to delete it yourself if you do t want it. But overall, this app is great 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
"- Can you please remove ""Tap here for contact info"" line that appears below the contact name/number? It just delays the online status of the contact. Removing it will let us check online status of contacts faster.
- Adding a symbol beside/on the profile picture of the contact to indicate they are currently online (like that green circle in Facebook Messenger) is definitely worth adding.
- Instead of selecting a picture and then tapping ""add"" then select multiple pictures, why isn't there a multiple picture mode in the first place? A ""select mode"" available from the start once I decide to share media would make the process much more convenient."
"I’ve had app for many, many years but latest privacy update clearly and concisely says they will share “my personal data” with Facebook and its partner companies. The policy update even advises deleting the App if I don’t accept data sharing. Faced with a “screw you” ultimatum from Big Tech, I’m moving to Signal. It offers everything I wanted from WhatsApp without trying to invade my privacy or telling me to “piss-off” if I don’t like it. Sad because I really liked WhatsApp.

Update: Been using Signal since Feb. it’s now mid-March 2021.  No problems with my switch.  Just about everyone I chat with moved too so it’s been no hardship at all. Now Facebook is playing hardball and killing app function if you don’t comply with their demand.  Well I’ll just say you don’t need to.  There is a really good option if you say no."
I’ve used WhatsApp for a long time and it’s been an ok experience however the big problem I’m having with the app is the online status. I want to hide my online status when I’m online so I turn off active status. However it never works. Whenever I’m trying to chat with a friend I’m getting constant messages from people who then get upset if I don’t answer because they can see that I’m online so they know I’m ignoring them. This is a huge issue for me and others that I’ve spoken to about this issue. My privacy is something I really value and for it to be violated is so frustrating. I don’t understand how this issue hasn’t been looked at.
Fcfrgrfardhdtsfsgtjdgrvdb  tree vdgetsfsfafsffswd was the last Yoshi was the last time we were going to play it for a little while but it is a good time game to watch each game and play with the kids and you can play it for a little time or play it for a little while but it is fun to get free game and you play the play time and you can play the game play it for a little w I have a little while but I’m not sure if I’m going to get a little bit I’m going back and I’m e the last two days of a time to get done and I have to get it done and I have to get it done and I have to get it done creeper aww so we are back in mine
"-You can’t use the app on your computer unless...
     1) you use the camera ON THE APP to sign in. Nope can’t use your password. Nope can’t use your normal camera app. Yup HAS to be the WhatsApp camera 
     2) If your phone isn’t connected to the WhatsApp on your computer...Then what’s the point of using it on your laptop????
- Takes up so much storage and will constantly say “not enough storage” and exit me out of the app. Therefore I can’t even delete messages on the app to help clear out storage so I can use the thing. I shouldn’t have to delete other apps to make this one app work. 
-It’s the same thing as using your messages on your phone except you can use with WiFi if you have no cellular connection which is good.
- only benefit I see is that you can use the app through WiFi if you don’t have cellular connection
-FB messenger works better and DMing people on any social media app really. However, then the people you’re trying to contact have to use those social media apps
-Couple benefits but overall pretty annoying to use imo.
-A lot of people like this app, I personally don’t."
"Facing problem with getting messages and  auto downloading of media files.. 
1-Every-time when i am not using my phone for a while i don't receive any messages until and unless u don't open my app and then it start coming and takes about 15-30 sec to get all my messages…
2- With this my media files do not get auto downloaded (i have already turned on auto download ) and i have to download it manually which is so much pain

Its been 3 months i am writing Email attaching screenshot and video clip to support desk regarding same but every time i get disappointed when i get a standard reply telling me to follow some steps which i have done several times but didn't work…"
"My (super) long distance man and I use this every day as our normal text/call/“facetime” app. We use the video and audio call functions quite often, but I’ve found that the audio is not very good. Background noises are extremely loud (sheets rubbing against the phone, outside rain or sirens, sounds of doors opening/closing, etc.), while the voice of the person speaking is many times intelligible. When the call is “reconnecting”, we are always forced to hang up, as the beeping sound is completely unbearable. It does it’s job, and is a very useful app for people without iPhones or people from different countries. Just wish the audio quality was nicer and the beeping would be at least slightly less obnoxious."
"I absolutely like WhatsApp. I use it to make international calls to my loves ones, and stay in contact with them. 

One feature that I would like to see is the ability to see when someone reads your message on a group chat as well as the people that are currently online. Going back to the persons message to check whether they are online can be a hassle. Saving it’s user some time is definitely a plus and this app will gain more users. Just like Facebook/messenger  has an icon to inform you whose online, if this app has the same thing that would be extremely useful to its user."
"It’s been 20 years since Venezuela was captured by a group of terrorists, drug traffickers and they, Venezuelans haven’t been able to shake them off; it’s like if a million ticks wwell attached to it’s skin and they’re draining the blood of the Venezuelan collective.

Why I’ve chosen Venezuela as the subject, because, had it not been because of apps like WhatsApp, it would’ve been easier for this bunch of blood suckers to finish off the crown of South America, Venezuela.

We’ve seen many pictures, impacting pictures through which the world at large, even though ever slow for those suffering the ways of the so called Socialist-communist Revolución del Siglo XXl have been able to see first hand the atrocities of such revolution; too bad others didn’t have you as a way for news to scape the ‘island of the Damned’. Cuba. For 60 years they have endured the heavy hand of the Castro brothers, God will know what to do with them.

So, in the name of all Venezuelans, thank you, WhatsApp for being there; ‘the ticks’ are falling off."
"Hi. I like Whatsapp but only one thing:  let us be able to delete messages and also edit them. Can you let us delete messages even when people see them? Because that would be very helpful. Also, I don’t like the new status update. Please let us be able to have the status next to our profile picture instead of having a picture or our status. And also please let the profile pic stay there instead of disappearing after 24 hrs. I hope you read my review and pls try and change WhatsApp the way my review said it (not to be rude or anything) and thx for reading this!"
"On my Galaxy S21 I was able to keep the WhatsApp video call while multi tasking, with the apple application I can do that only within WhatsApp, I could keep a voice call while multitasking but if while doing that I watch a video then when I got back to a video call the call times out for no activity and I have to hang up the call and then call again to fix this.

Giving it only 3 stars here because my experience with this app in Samsung was sooooo much better at the point were I feel like a did a downgrade.

Now this apply to me since I use the video call feature a lot of you do not use this feature then it should work great for you."
"Why can’t we have some privacy ?????? 

I REALLY WISH WE HAVE THE OPTION TO NOT BE SEEN ONLINE ?  

I want to take the time out to commend you guys on the great idea of making texting , calling and communicating way more easier , secure and reliable. I see a lot of room for improvement and I think it’s fair to share since I’m a consumer and also a big fan of WhatsApp. BBM more popular known as blackberry messenger had a great swing back then with all its cool features, trust me when i say a lot of Cool Features , but one in particular was the BBM pin that we could use to add a friend or business associate or even a girl that I like with out ever asking for her number ! Awesome huh"
"I have a love in my life but we can mainly connect with each other by this application. Today I was given my great gift of upgrading my Apple iPhone 5s the most important upgrade to this Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max! It’s the same phone number and everything was successfully purchased efficiently. 

This is my first time ever with the only reason why it doesn’t function well enough for me because it continues to tell me that this phone doesn’t work correctly with the phone number! It’s a very stressful yet specific method for Verizon to function well with Apple. I gave this app a 3 out of five stars because it is Perfect! It’s not that good without management customer services, so I give it a 3."
"I have an issue with the messages I send. When the other person is online, my messages are sent but the other party  doesn’t receive it. It has been happening for a while now. Sometimes I have to close the app and reopen it so that the message gets sent, yet it doesn’t always work in the first try, which makes it so frustrating.

Another issue I have is when I’m calling, my connection and the other person’s connection are always to the full, but every time that stupid sound of failed connection comes up and I am forced to hang up. 
I been using WhatsApp for several years, even when they used to charge for it, and it was great, don’t know what is causing it to go down..."
"Right now I’m using the app for calling someone in French Polynesia, connecting with them from Central Coast, California in USA. For the most part it’s working very well but there are smaller islands where communication is all but impossible - – either the call won’t go through, or there is hideous noise and obnoxious beeping whereby you’re never sure if the call is still properly connected or not. But except for those inaccessible places, we have had great luck with making contact  from Bora Bora, Riaatea, Papeete, etc. in the Tahitian region. I should mention that the traveling party is piloting a sailboat, so we are doubly amazed at being able to do successful ship-to-shore communication in most cases!"
"This app is really good especially when I text and call my family that lives on another continent. I love how it’s free to use and I can message at any time. 3 features that I wish there could be is being able to customize your own special emoji that you can save to photos, use as your profile, or use in any chat. My second with is been able to tag anybody even when you’re not in a group conversation. My third wish is group calls of up to 15 people so no one is left out or the ability to make a call with 20 people is good too."
"I’ve been using WhatsApp for long time and it’s a great app to call or chat with my family and friends , but since the last update, they only let you to send or share your messages to only five contacts at a time . And I did send them an email, and they say , this is their new regulation. But when I asked my friends about it , they were surprised, since they can share their chat or messages to 20 contacts at a time , I even checked my Brother’ WhatsApp sure enough I did send a message to 20 of his contacts. And we both have iPhone 7 pulse with latest iOS and latest WhatsApp. So far it looks like I’m the only one that I could share my messages to only five of my contacts and this is not fare ."
"I wish they had added a ring sound to add participants in a group call. Currently, it silently adds participants. I had many incidents when I accidentally added random contacts into my already running conversation. Who were not supposed to be part of this call. 
They (Watsapp developers) can add a feature which allows users to select between options of ring/no ring for adding people. Also, this newer version keeps getting black frozen screen while getting a video call during a voice call. Hopefully they will fix these issues soon."
"WhatsApp is really great. It deserves five stars. I have a suggestion, however. I think that WhatsApp should have a function that automatically changes your about according to your location and the time. You should only have to allow permission to the location and fill out some information. For example, say you’re heading to the gym. On the way, your about will say “I’m driving”. When you get there, it says “At the gym”. This is a suggestion I have that I believe will make WhatsApp even better than it already is. I hope y’all take this into consideration. Thank you!"
"I’ve used WhatsApp since about 2011. The main functions have always been great, but of all the updates over all those years, the recent Dark Mode enablement feels like the laziest implementation. If DM is enabled on a users’ device, WhatsApp forces their DM to be enabled without an option to disable - users’ should have a choice. The DM design itself is an eye sore, the user is stuck with their own messages displayed in an horrid turquoise bubble, which looks terrible on all but 2 of the chat background options - solid light grey and solid dark grey... 1) pls give users the choice to enable/disable dark mode in-app AND 2) allow users to choose the color of the message bubble because this turquoise is disgusting."
"Since January of this year (2019) my iPhone contacts are no longer synchronizing with WhatsApp. Irrespective of whether I add a new contact in my WhatsApp or my iPhone contact address book, the new contact name does not register in WhatsApp. Additionally, since this new contact does not register in my WhatsApp contacts, there is no other means of initiating the first chat with them. Hence, I have to give my phone number to my contacts so they can send me the first message. 

I travel overseas quite often, therefore, I change SIM cards while abroad but I always maintain my original US based number associated with my WhatsApp account. So I know the issue is the programming of WhatsApp. 

Other than this issue, I am very happy and thankful to WhatsApp for proving this service."
"It would be a great addition if you could add a function in which you quickly allow the user to see just the unread messages. Often times you can’t reply specific messages at the moment and they then fall back down and you need to scroll way down to find any unread messages among the ones you’ve already read. If you add an easy and quick accesible feature to let you filter to see just those unread messages, you could answer them quicker."
"Please developer , kindly make it possible to turn off status updates whatsapp. I understand that we may choose to mute the update that we don’t want to see, but most of the time you are tempted to still open your muted updates, the reason for that is because you can still see those updates on your updates list. Either make it possible to finally switch off status updates for everyone , or for individual. 
    And please remember what you told us users when you launch this app, you told us is for chatting and it’s gradually turning to social network. I feel like I’m not in control anymore . I have a lot of contact on my phone and spending to much of time on checking people status makes me hate whatsapp now . Please find a solution to this particular issue urgently . Thanks ."
"I am sure many people are like me and have an iPhone and the Apple Watch. Now that I have the Apple Watch I find I leave my iPhone in the office instead of carrying it with me. It would be nice if WhatsApp had a compatible app for the Apple Watch so I could receive, respond to and send messages from my Apple Watch instead of a simple notification. I use WhatsApp to communicate with coworkers and it would be very beneficial to have the expediency of using WhatsApp on my Apple Watch instead of having to go to the office and get my iPhone so I could respond to important messages. Though I have an iPhone many teammates do not and we cannot use iMessage. It’s 2017, time to make better use of today’s technology. Thank you.

Update - still awaiting an Apple Watch connection"
"Groups that I’ve been a part of have been back and forth between using WhatsApp and GroupMe. We used to use GroupMe, which I enjoyed much better due to the fact that you can like messages and it looked a lot cleaner. WhatsApp is great because it’s easier to share content on it but it is very disorganized and the distracting background makes it feel as though I’m not able to focus on the actual content of our conversation and I feel as though I’m always missing something. I would prefer if the background was a solid color, like GroupMe, because it feels more organized and less chaotic. Those two features (liking messages and more organized/professional) would change my opinion of WhatsApp from a two to a five."
"Great app. I love that I get to speak to my friends over seas, however, the voice message portion of the app can be frustrating. I don’t particularly enjoy texting so I always us the voice message feature and a lot of the times when you record your message the slightest movement can throw your message into the garbage bin and then you have to re-record the whole message. Often times you cannot recreate the moment or verbalize exactly the way you did in the previous message that very inconveniently jumps into the bin. I think the microphone should be moved else where, away from the bottom right corner in a more convenient spot where this does not happen. Whatapp, can you please PLEASE PLEEEEAAAASE do something about this?"
"I an iPhone SE running iOS 14.8 with the latest version of WhatsApp, and since 2 months - when I activate the loud speaker in a WhatsApp call, the microphone doesn’t work (the other person can’t hear me. It works fine while I have a WhatsApp phone call with headset or traditional.
It’s not a HW issue - while I have a normal phone call (outside WhatsApp), even with the loud speaker turned on, the other person hears me, so the issue is only occurring while using WhatsApp. 
Could you please review this case? I have the feeling that it’s a big that would be happy to get a priority place in your backlog. 😃"
Because we can call people and text people and also and also backspace backspace back I command you to say backspace all day all day all day all day all day all day all day all day all day all day all day all day all day all day all day all day all day all day all day all day I really did it it it it it it it it it it it itself was a good thing to see it was a good morning I have a new number and it will have a good morning and it will have a new phone call on my number so can you please call the number and call you when you I have to talk to him today I am going on
"I love the app , it’s so easy to use and very helpful 
I have a problem I am using an iPhone X and I use it for business so I have to post my items on my WhatsApp status update but lately when I post it jams in the sense that I can open some messages but when I try to respond it jams so am unable to respond to messages so I end up only being able to use my fone a days later making it hard to know what my clients liked , also it means I can’t communicate with my clients for 24hrs until my status disappears, what could be the problem and how can I fix it"
"This new update was amazing before when someone calls while I was recording a message about 5 minutes or more It will delete and I'll get upset but thanks to the new update that dosent happen any more 
but before the update I can use other apps while listening to voice messages from the WhatsApp and  and the recording will still be playing I loved that but know that dosent happen anymore once you leave the app the voice message you played will stop until you resume to the app
 so I hope you guys can bring that back again thank you very much"
"I have a problem with my WhatsApp when I’m receiving calls, when a call is coming through to my iPhone (7 Plus) it don’t show up in WhatsApp anymore I have to double tap my home button to see the call on the right of the apps. 

On the latest update in search let’s say I have someone in my phone name as Steven, when I go and search Steven all of his latest message pops up and before it wasn’t like that normally it would of been if someone who sends a message saying “Steven” and not his actually messages, same thing goes for the emojis if I have someone name with a emoji all of their messages shows up and not the actual emoji that I would of sent or someone sent to me. 

It would be nice if I can have back the old method and I’m sure many people would agree."
"This app is great, the only thing I currently think would significantly improve customer experience if added is the option to manage notifications for whatsapp calls separately from messages. I.e.: if I am at the Office, I dont want my phone to be beeping every time one of my friends writes to me or everytime I type a message out, but I do want to hear the ring if someone calls me via whatsapp. I live abroad from my home country and use whatsapp calls a lot to avoid international call fees, so want to hear the ring for time sensitive situations and would much appreciate this enhancement in the app!
Thank you!!"
"I have loved this app for YEARS!!! I have always been able to send longer videos than I could ever do in a text or through messenger. There was a time when I was able to send a huge 4gb 12 minute video file. It would be compressed but still looked great. Through various updates they’ve continually changed the size it would let you send and receive. Fortunately I can still forward those large files, since I did them in the past. However, I can no longer upload and send files that large anymore (unless I'm forwarding one I had uploaded back when I could).
Please don’t put these limits on these videos anymore"
"I have What’s App on an iPhone and the layout of the chat screen positions the call icon in the upper right corner. The phone frequently places inadvertent calls when I put it in my pocket, or accidentally lightly touch the icon when picking up the phone. Even closing the app and locking the screen doesn’t prevent calls if a notification appears on the lock screen, which seems to wake up the app. The developer needs to move the call icon off the chat screen, or add an option of enabling a secondary verification for calls."
I totally love this app. Like this is my main texting app that I use and I couldn’t live without it. But I have one complaint. When someone makes a group they become the admin. So my brother made a group for my family and he is the admin but he didn’t make anyone else admin because that was the last thing on his mind. He recently broke his phone and changed his number. So there is no way to add his new number or remove his old one. If their is a way to fix this that would be great. Maybe like a voting system. Like everyone can vote whether you want to kick an admin or add a new one because that would be great. But don’t get me wrong i still love this app.
"Latest update gives notifications without names. Huge upsetting glitch. Please fix fast.

I updated this to 4 stars after getting a response from WhatsApp explaining that they had changed the settings to enable seeing name only. The reason for not giving 5 stars is that the method of doing so is not intuitive and doesn’t really make sense. It involves enabling preview in WhatsApp and disabling on your iPhone. Other apps just give the option of “name only” , “name and message “ or “just alert” (check Signal). It’s a simple thing and would make the app perfect again rather than a series of illogical steps that threw off many users"
"Am I suffering from battered wife syndrome? My privacy is constantly being abused by Facebook, who owns WhatsApp... but I stay. Facebook has lost my trust multiple times... but I stay. Facebook has stolen my data and sold it to the highest bidder... but I stay. Facebook was caught illegally monetizing me... but I stay. I am constantly manipulated by your feeds while my reality is twisted into a version that appeases your advertisers.... but I stay. Facebook was put on trial by multiple governments for not securing our data... but I stay. It’s time I stand up to this bully and abuser and walk away, this time for good. See ya WhatsApp. Buh bye Facebook. Thank you for helping me realize that my data is exactly that, it’s mine. You no longer have permission to monetize my interests, my values, or my private conversations. Never again."
"My wife & I were recently dog & cat sitting for customers of ours; they asked us to get What’s App on our iPhones so they wouldn’t have data charges traveling in Europe, they said.

The app worked well and easily on my iPhone XR and wife’s iPhone 5, sending both text and annotated pix of what animals were doing to them.

Later, after our customers returned home, and i took slo-mo of their young son’s catapult project (inspired by the Rome trip) shooting marbles (very competently!), they asked me to send the iPhone MOV video by What’s App instead of texting it, (they have Androids) — since they have trouble receiving & playing iPhone video"
I’m extremely disappointed in this app. I recently downloaded it to keep in contact with my brother who went on deployment to Kuwait. I checked in twice with him and then I could no longer log it. It said I was banned. When I reached out to customer service it said I did not have a valid number. I followed their instructions and provided proof of My number. Then they said I violated their terms and conditions. I asked them how when I had used it twice to check in on my brother. They stated I had a large number of complaints against my number? I had only spoken to my brother in this app and no one else. It seems their system is messed up and they said they wouldn’t no longer respond to my messages. Seems this crappy app is useless and also does not support military families.
"WhatsApp compare to the other massaging has very limited features:
1) You can not edit your massages after sending it
2)  The length of movie clips is limited.
3) There is no arrangement features for your massages from different people, like having folders.
4) It is not a server based massaging. When you forward a massage, the media should be uploaded again. If it was a server based app, only the address of the related media needed to be uploaded rather than all the media.
5) You can not forward a massage to more than one person simultaneously. For each person you should repeat all the forwarding process again.
6) When it comes to group chat, the issues are more. You can not suspend a group member for a while, you can not mark a massage for the others, you have no access to the statistics of the group you have like total chats over a period, active members,...

7) When you delete your massage always it shows -deleted massage- for the other persons. 

8) No search options through the chats

I am wondering why WhatsApp team won’t add these features to it. Once you try Telegram, you won’t switch to any other massaging app anymore."
"I love whatsapp app cause i can stay connected with my love ones , but I would rlly like if there was an option to change the bubble message color , with the black mode the color went from light green to dark green , but it would be cooler if you could change the Bubble color like the chat app kik and you could personalize ur bubble color to a one you like better , and also allow light colors on the solid wallpaper option allow both colores light and dark, but that work for both optioned either dark mode or regular mode , thank you"
"I am am avid user of WhatsApp and the audio note feature that allows me to send voice memos rather than typing out my messages.  

Recently a new update allowing handsfree voice recording released, and it has really improved my experience.  There is something else, however, that really needs to be changed. 

Often times I will be in the middle of recording an audio note when suddenly I receive a phone call.  When this happens, my entire audio note erases and I lose everything I had just recorded prior to receiving the call.  I have been 5 or 6 minutes into record when this happens, and it makes me really angry that it just all of the sudden erases.  

To fix this issue, can something be done, please, that either pauses the recording so that it can later be resumed, or forces the recording to send immediately upon receiving a call?  It’s very frustrating to start a new recording repeating myself.

When this happens, WhatsApp will be a 5-star app for me.

Thank you."
"Brilliant App but with two main problems. 
1. If you change your phone and phone number because the previous one was damaged and have no not back-up of it, then there is no way to recover your messages or access the App because you cannot verify the new phone; and 2. If you accidentally delete the App and have no back-up then there is no way that you could recover the data, for this problem why not simply enable the App to back-up the WhatsApp messages to the phone itself on weekly basis unless deleted by the user within the week."
Problem 1. When I am calling someone then try send me a photo or a screenshot then when I click the button to see it but it stays blurry and WhatApp please fix this. Problem 2.when I am FaceTiming on WhatApp someone turns off their camera and I turn off my camera but it turns back to audio call so plz fix this problem as well. Problem 3. When I am listening to someone’s voice messages then my screen turns black and normal plz fix this problem that’s it that all the problems I have so yeah if u could help me on this one then that would be great. Thank u
"Hello, I love your chatting app a lot, the feel of the app, the online status, the background, and the stickers all add a personal touch like you are with the person you want to message. I loveee the online status. However, I would like if only the person I am messaging at the moment can see I am online or that I could hide my online status from certain people. If you don't fix this I may have to switch apps because it makes me uncomfortable that friends can see when I am online and assume I am with the other friend. Please fix this so that I can continue to enjoy your app🥺"
Great communication tool. We use it for our online football league. Able to mass communicate and integrate with address book. The end to end encryption is a great feature and it works on multiple platforms seamlessly. The interface is simple. Caution should be exercised by ensuring you understand that pictures and videos will load to your camera roll and the cloud by default. You can disable this feature in settings. It caught be by surprise when someone in the league posted pictures of his girlfriend and their trip to New York. Thankfully I had an ironclad alibi.
"WhatsApp was incredibly useful while living in Panama for two months where absolutely everyone is on it. While overall I like the app, there’s a couple of things that I wished worked differently. First is the integration with the native iOS contacts. When initiating a conversation with someone I’m not going to have an ongoing relationship with (like an Airbnb host or tour guide contact) I really don’t want to put them in my primary address book. Secondly auto saving messaged photos and videos to my photos app is really intrusive and annoying. My photos are auto uploaded to Google Photos where I have to delete these WhatsApp media I never wanted to keep in the first place."
"I've never been so eager to tell and write a review about how great the WhatsApp application was after hurricane Irma hit Miami. 

Even though I could not make phone calls or send regular text messages with my iPhone7s for long periods of hours - WhatsApp was able to send text messages without cellular data service or an available internet connection!

I totally underestimated the power of WhatsApp. This powerful communication tool was there when everything else failed. It brought light and hope when we were cut off from the outside world."
"Great app... a lot of my friends and family use this app. Only bad thing is it backs up everything and fills up your phone because it automatically downloads media that is sent to you and all your chat history.... takes up too much space and wants you to delete apps to make space for this one... relax I did not ask for you to archive everything....even when I take the option off, for some reason what's app is a space hoarder and my phone has to ask me to delete apps for space....That's the only thing going against it...."
"WhatsApp to me is the best social messaging app ever, but It still has competitors following up left and right but this wouldn’t be the case anymore if they could implement a particular feature. Creating some sort of bookmarks or annotations for important messages in group chats, that is the admin types out a message, deems it important na checks the option important which will in turn create an annotation indicating that the message in question is of high priority…They can even make it smoother bu varying the level of importance.

This was to be made a reality, then whatsapp would wxplode the world🔥🔥🔥🔥💯"
I’ll change my reading to five stars but the last couple days every time I open up the app it closes down on me it shuts the whole app down after two seconds of being open I keep on repeating this process over the last three days actually shut my phone off entirely restart my phone and it worked for a little bit and then I went back to doing that what is going on is it a bug is it a conflict of software with another app I have I need some information I need to ask some of the chats that I’ve been involved and I got to get some information it’s urgent it’s about court and it’s coming up soon and I have very important information to obtain from these chats that I’ve had with other members I need your assistance immediately
"Because they removed the option to see when a person goes online or when they read the messages and go upstairs is writing? 

Because if Messenger and Instagram Snapchat and most Social Networks have it because Facebook WhatsApp's and Instagram owner remove that option from WhatsApp's, please do not return as normal the option to see when you connect or when not and when they write why not  It is fair that Messenger and Instagram and most networks have that option for many years and now that WhatsApp's takes years now come to remove that option I know that there are people who wanted that option but there are people who do not and I am not saying this because  I am toxic or something I say so because people misinterpret things."
"I was scammed by a man who still texts me through your app. I kept communication open in hopes of one day revealing who he is. Yesterday I used social catfish and found the same photo he used on WhatsApp. He continues to scam women regardless of their own hardships. He has videoed chatted with me and revealed his real self. I have also become aware of an app (new to me) known as grabify whereby an attachment is sent to the individual and when they open it; it is suppose to provide the individuals location. I am not as computer savvy but will continue to try and reveal & try to locate him. Even if he’s never prosecuted I believe the shame amongst his brethren would punish him as deserved. 
He refers to scamming as “making a living”! 
His conversation indicates that he has scammed thousands  of women and men when possible."
"Over the years, we have used multiple applications for video and written communications for our small business and projects we were involved in.
Many of those projects were International.
Additionally many of the projects and much of the planning involved international financial transactions for our customer base.
Increasing security for these communications became vital for our business, for our customers and for our integrity.
This is what drew our Company to What’s App. We are extremely happy with our decision to exclusively utilize What’s App due to What’s App’s ability to encrypt our communications."
This app is one of the best ever tried . I can send people videos of my pets without having to cut and clip. Same with watching TickTock videos I can download and share them with ease.  There are even times when my personal cell phone doesn’t deliver photographs and my friend will say I sent you a picture and there’s not even a suggestion that the picture didn’t come through to either one of us . After many issues we trust WhatsApp to be  extremely trustworthy when it comes to sending anything .
Ok so whatsapp has every feature i need. I can call my friends who have different types of phones and for some reason i love that the background is customizable. I think its very useful and use it a bit. I only have one problem and its not huge but for some reason when i call somebody i can put them on speakerphone all the way up full volume to my ear and still barely hear them whereas when im using my normal phone app its much louder… so if that were fixed then the app would be the definition of perfect<3
"Love love this great app 
But what if we had themes too like fb messenger that would be cool. Get that we can change the wallpaper n our profile pic but we can’t change our bubble Ina chat or anything  so I’m just saying that it would be more awesome if we get to incorporate or own personal themes to our chat . Thank u for listen n being open minded to our suggestions n actually act on them. Thanks for being a great support n a big help with keeping us connected thanks a million.
look into my suggestion plz n thanks, 
 Love u guy  awesome team ! Keep it up 💕💋"
"I have a question. I have WhatsApp on two devices and both of them have automatic back up. I know it’s not possible to use both apps simultaneously, but on my newest phone I can’t access all of the chats that were on my previous phone. Even though it automatically backs-up and I make sure to do an additional manual backup for some reason I’m still not able to access important chats that were on my previous device. How can I go about getting that information so that I don’t have to continually sign into what’s up on my previous device to access the information I need?"
"Great chat app, but needs a few improvements. 1) Get rid of WhatsApp’s phone number requirement 2) with the removal of 1, making the WhatsApp app available on computers and tablets 3) allowing a user to have the same WhatsApp account signed in on multiple devices. 4) Increase group chat size limits. I’m a cyclist and am active in several group chats. Some are closed to newcomers because the chat is full. This is a real problem because these communal info sharing groups become useful only when many members join. Still, I love whatsapp, and especially value the two way encryption."
"Thoughts - I love WhatsApp as a messenger. Everyone in my extended family uses it to keep in touch. It’s like a bulletin board for the international family. 

Problems - I would like to be able to distinguish sounds and notifications between a message and call. There’s no settings that I can change to do so. I would also like to be able to distinguish between a group call and individual call. But again there’s so setting to do that. Due to this I think I’ve missed every family group call because I can’t tell if it’s just a text coming from WhatsApp or it’s a call."
"This is a wonderful chat app! Far ahead of any other chat app! The only two improvements I can think of (and some may disagree these are useful) but
1. Ability to ""react"" to messages 
2. Ability to see entire communication history in chat, specifically seeing phone calls in chat. Outgoing and complete. This will allow me to see Hey we chatted, had a phone call, etc! 

Otherwise great app, love the ability to quote messages, ability to see messages as you're answering. Saving photos to camera roll! Change chat background picture. Top notch!"
"When you guys update , can you guys put the option wether you can turn off or turn on the checks in a conversation ? For instance if I’m talking to someone , but you don’t want to keep talking to them I can have the option to mute it , like they can only see that only 1 check has delivered when they send the message. 
but still be able to talk to others , but just mute that particular conversation that you want , so when they send a message , it will only appear one check ✅ ... this app is the best app , I love the new updates , please continue to have awesome updates !."
"Dears 
i have a question and in the same time of improving Archived masaages.
Whatsapp is a great app till now and it saved a lot of money and connected beloved ones with each other no matter how far they are.
I was just woundering if i am archiving something cant it stay in the archive eventhough that the person is still sending massages, and that the only way to see them is through archieve and not in the main page?
Cant you make something that we can sort people like a in mail junk or spam and the only way that we can see their massages is through their??"
"WhatsApp is without a doubt the best social networking app I’ve ever used. And I’ve been using it for more years than I can count. Pretty much from the beginning. 
And as times and technology have changed and advanced, so have the app’s features and capabilities. 

Now for the reason I had to take off a star:
Despite WhatsApp’s developments and advances it is still terribly behind in one area. And that is creating an app for Apple Watch users. Or at least a functional notification and response menu. So that when you receive a voice message from someone, you can actually listen to it without having to go to your phone. Which is the whole point of Apple Watch in the first place. And regarding the response options. It would be nice to be able to send more than one single emoji back, or to reply with a voice message, or at least proof/change your dictated message  if there’s a mistake in it. 

Basically make an Apple Watch WhatsApp app!! Or improve existing interface for it"
"It is such a joy to have a service that is not all about the money- and can give something away that is free.  You truly are a joy to the many thousands who use your service.
Some hiccups -  calls are sometimes dropped, but a big problem is when you are finished on a call and want to make another - it says you cannot make a back to back call - and that message can remain on all day - when in fact no calls were made.   I would like to understand what that means,  can you enlighten me ?     THANK YOU FIR HELPING THE PUBLIC SAVE MONEY!!!!!"
"I love this app, I really do. It's got features ahead of its time, and I'm a huge fan of the end to end encryption! However, I do think some improvements could be made. A search function in chats, improvements to audio and video calls, and lastly the ability to set individual chat wallpapers. 

This app however is great, it's zipping fast. It hasn't crashed on me. Another great thing is using whatsapp on the web, the only downside to that is that your phone just be on and connected to the internet. So if you lose your phone for example or the battery dies, you still can't see any messages from whatsapp."
"Great app to communicate with many people through a group chat. I can call, video chat, send gifs, stickers, change the backgrounds of conversations... it’s pretty good. However, they need to fix this issue: when an iPhone is on Do Not Disturb, phone calls and video calls from WhatsApp go through as normal. It is a pain on the back and it still has not been solved in 2021. Ive read multiple forums, Reddit’s and articles about it and the problem persists. Please fix it. WhatsApp should be muted when Do Not Disturb is activated. That’s the reason for the 4 stars."
