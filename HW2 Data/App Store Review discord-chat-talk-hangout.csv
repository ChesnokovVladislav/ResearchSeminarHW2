"Since I joined my first server, it took some time for me to get used to all the functionality. There were so many things I didn’t know about, and yet that’s one of Discord’s biggest selling points. Most of the time if you want to do something, you can. Mark a server or channel as NSFW or 18+? You can do that. Change your display name for only one, specific server? You can do that too. But for me the most valuable thing about Discord is the sense of community that you feel almost immediately after logging on. Depending on your server choices you’ll almost always have an unread message, meaning there’s almost always something or someone for you to come back to. And if you don’t want to be bothered? Turn off notifications for servers and channels you don’t want to hear from. Not once have I had a security issue or even fear that I would lose personal information. Setting up 2-factor authentication was the easiest security experience I have had in a long time, and if you still have concerns, you won’t be required to even give Discord your phone number,  much less your name and other personal info. When I’m not using the in-built messages app on my phone or tablet, Discord is my #1 default"
"I’ve had Discord for about three years now, and it does what it’s supposed to, but there are many features that are annoying to say the least. My main issue with Discord is that it seems like they don’t care about the mobile app as much as they should. There are many features that don’t work on mobile but should such as: editing the About Me (it doesn’t save on my mobile app), attaching files to messages, marking images with spoilers, managing purchases, and using certain owner/administrator features. Also, Discord does not offer a desktop app for iPads, which are more than capable of running a Mac version of the app. And they don’t offer an easy way to access the browser version on mobile devices. The only way to access the browser site on a mobile device is by copying and pasting a link from your computer into your device and signing in from there, which is very inconvenient.  But I would say my biggest complaint is that instead of addressing these issues with the mobile app, Discord pushes features that are seemingly unnecessary, when there are more pressing matters that should be addressed. But other than that it fulfills its purpose well, and if the mobile app issues were addressed, I would be more than happy to give this app five stars. But because of this seeming disinterest in fixing some of the features in the mobile app, I can’t in good conscience give them a perfect rating."
"Don’t get me wrong, I love Discord, but ever since the update that made the text box cluttered with so many buttons, I feel like the app lost some of its uniqueness (and gained more glitches, at least with my phone). It feels like iMessages and the text box feels so small when I write because I can only get five or six words to a line when I used to get the entire width of my phone screen besides where the “send” button was (the one that didn’t used to be so obnoxious). I guess you could say I miss the simplicity of the chat box. 

Also, the movement of the it when you click into the text box versus when you click out glitches on me and makes the whole app slow when switching between chats, channels, or servers. Everything lags behind and it gets to be pretty annoying. 

One thing I absolutely love, though, is that when you type something, but let’s say your phone dies (like mine did twice), Discord saves what you wrote in the chat box! I have been saved so many times by that feature. Discord is a great app and I use it for so many things, but I also write a lot on it, so what I wrote affects me the way it might not affect others. The 2,000 character limit can get a bit irritating, too, so I wish there was a way you could switch the limit off, but I’ve found ways to work around it so it’s not an immediate issue. Overall, I love Discord, but I miss some things from its “Dark Ages,” as they called it."
"I love the app, great to talk to my friends and everything, service is improving with each update and I’m able to find different chats easily enough. When it comes to discussing subjects like books or movies, though, I want to make sure that I’d have a spoiler tag to hide the words or image so people who don’t want to be spoiled stay spoiler-free. Problem is, through research when I couldn’t find it, there is no way to make a picture or sentence “spoiler hidden”, which ends up having me to avoid any postings or talk about movies and such. Having a way to turn a picture or post onto a spoiler post would be something fine since it exists on every other device known. Also setting a custom status is also a slight pain, once you make one it either disappears after a small time or stays forever, but what about having the option to save a custom status? So that way you could have up to three you can switch between or turn off on the fly without having to delete it and go through the process of making the same custom status all over again. I want to let my friends know when I’m at work, if I’m still asleep and other such so they don’t have to guess why I’m idle. I know Discord can’t make everything happen, but some quality of life improvements and features that actually match all the other versions would be nice after all this time. But it’s a great app, still."
I have been having discord for two years and this thing that’s happening I’m starting to not like it so lately my profile has been becoming pixelated and every time I change it to my friends profile who don’t have a pixelated it becomes pixelated for me I don’t know what’s going on but I definitely want this problem to be fixed because I look so weird with the pixelated pfp idk what’s up with this but please fix it I do not like my profile being pixelated every time I change my profile to my friends it always comes out pixelated for me but not pixelated for though I even went on PC and I tried on my phone and it still makes it pixelated I don’t know what’s up but discord I think your update is making profiles pixelated because my friends profile is pixelated too and I don’t know what’s going on with the profiles but please fix it I don’t know if y’all are making a new update for Discord and it’s hacking peoples profiles I don’t know because everyone profile is pixelated to it’s not only me and my friends it’s a lot of people read it is talking about this too so I don’t really know what to do please know that I want this to not be some type of hack because this happened on other social media‘s and I hope this is not some type of hack and I hope it’s kind of like a update y’all are trying to do right now but please fix it I hope that this is that some type of hack please and thank you!!
"Discord is an amazing app that lets you do casual conversations without the loud notifications you would usually get from text messages. It does an amazing job at keeping notifications hidden when you want them to be.
But I cannot say the same for calls. Recently, Discord started integrating their calls with actual phone calls. This means that every time I get called on Discord, it goes through to my ringtone. The whole reason I use Discord is to keep my online life separate from my personal life. 
Although there is a setting that allows you to disable this feature, I still get the ringtone. Whenever I get called on Discord, even though the app is closed, I still get a ringtone. I even have all notifications turned off in my settings. The ringtone only lasts about 2 seconds before it realizes that it should not be there, but it gets pretty annoying, since it forces me to stop whatever i’m doing on my phone.
What annoys me the most is that this issue has been fixed before. The previous update had the setting that disabled the integrated phone calls, but it actually did its job, unlike this recent update. I had no calls going through no matter how much I was getting spammed with calls. 
I thought this problem would be gone forever, but it still managed to find its way back. I’ve resorted to having to delete the app just to avoid the ringtone...again. Please fix this issue."
"I like Discord because the app allowed me to meet many people and get myself involved with different activities but during texting sometimes the “connecting” makes it glitch and then my messages can’t be sent at all. I could easily leave the app and refresh it but it’s a pain when it happens all the time. I’m afraid one day the app would kick me out and all of my text would disappear, my time wasted. Every update I hope this gets fixed but I heard Discord isn’t very efficient in fixing their app compare to their desktop version. I do update it, but it’s no use when the same issue arises over and over again. Please fix it. It used to not do this before and if I knew this was going to happen I wouldn’t have updated the app. But then that would prevent me from other perks like background gifs and each individual server pfp from Nitro. I’m usually on mobile because of how convenient it is to bring around the house and when I go out so I use it more than desktop. So if Discord could please keep up with the updates on the app as much as the desktop, that would be greatly appreciated. Especially this buffering of sending messages, since it’s an annoying hiccup that keeps coming up despite being small. Otherwise, it’s a great app that has me spending on it even though I told myself I would never spend on an app."
"Sure, Discord is much better in terms of quality, but by far my biggest complaint is the removal of the private mode option while calling people. I deserve a right to privacy, as does everyone else, and it’s too loud for that to be an option. Other people can hear my conversations and it’s very bothersome. I miss having the option between the two. Don’t fix something that isn’t broken please! Otherwise, there’s this constant bug with webcams/ turning on your camera. sometimes it never loads and you have to turn it off and on to get it to work properly. I’ve had to do this up to 3 times maximum to get it to work finally, which is nothing at first, but becomes annoying. Finally, (most likely not 100% discord’s fault, you can ignore this if you want) the connection seems to be getting worse. I used to love discord for the quality of the calls, but several times a week the quality becomes so bad that I have to restart the call several times to understand a sentence the recipient. The most common connection issue is definitely the that audio seems to skip out entirely for a few seconds sometimes. I understand that this could also be due to my own connection and the recipient’s connection, so take this with a grain of salt. Considering that, many times before there has been nothing wrong with our internet and this still happens."
"From the very beginning, I have had numerous problems with this app. The only reason I am giving it two stars is because when it does work, it is phenomenal. 
When I first got the app, it wouldn’t let me join the server I wanted to and said I was banned (even though I’d never used the app before). I re-downloaded the app recently because I was joining a clan and they required discord. I got the app and I was still logged into my old account, which was glitched, so I created a new one. I actually had to create that account on my browser because the app didn’t even let me do that. I created my account and tried to login on the app, no success. I’ve re-downloaded the app numerous times since then and still, no success logging in. Luckily, my browser still works and I use that to chat with my clan. Unfortunately, even when I turn my phone sideways, I can’t see all of the writing because it shows all the members of the group on the right hand side and it takes up half of the screen. Then, I have to read downwards one letter at a time and I don’t have the patience for that, especially with all of the scrolling it requires. If I could get on the app and not have to worry about that, I would have no complaints, but this simple fix is ruining the entire app for me. If you want people to use your app, they have to be able to create an account, but so far I haven’t had any luck with that."
"I love using discord, great to talk to friends on here, but i have one problem is that whenever I’m on call with my friends and I’m away from my phone either they wanna call a group chat or someone calls me I don’t hear it saying that this person or group chat name is calling me and I never know until I go to my phone and notice it later that someone call me or I have to manually go back to my phone and join the call, I don’t know if it’s just me but it’s been happening for a while and when I’m not in a call and off of discord and someone calls me I hear it saying that this person is calling me, just not when I’m already in a call, which it did before. Also I think maybe they could add in where we can record our private or group chat calls to like record for memories or something cause you’d always want to remember those moments and I know you can in servers but not in private calls, which I think it should, to record the funny moments going on and not just audio but maybe record when we turn our cams to cause we all be doing funny things and also for security too if someone calls someone in private chat and keep harassing a lot of people and need to record the audio or camera too incase if they do have their camera on and doing something wrong."
"I will start this review by saying that I haven’t actually been able to use discord. I downloaded the app for a school class but when prompted to verify my number, it wouldn’t accept it because it was linked with another account. So, I went through the process of trying to find an account I had created years prior. In the meantime I contacted support and got a very quick robot response telling me to do exactly what I had just done. I found the old accounts and deleted them. However, that wasn’t enough. Apparently when you press delete on an account it takes an additional 14 days before discord actually deletes it. A day later, support for back to me and told me that I needed to send a copy of the error message I was receiving (even though I had already stated it in the last email). So I did. And a day later I still have received no response. I had to sort this issue out myself and eventually found that simply deleting the account wouldn’t remove the phone number associated with it. Finally to remove a phone number from an account I had to add ANOTHER email in the process - further convoluting the account issue. And finally, after 20 to 30 “account verifications”, 4 password resets, zero help from discord- I had access to a discord account. A whole 3 days later. All of this could’ve been resolved if I had access to someone at discord who knew a lick about user accounts and how to immediately delete them."
"Honestly, this app is what gets me through a lot of boredom in my day. It’s great, and even on the occasions there’s a problem, the devs tend to fix it rapidly with surprising speed. I use Discord to Role-play a lot, in fact it’s become my favorite pass time for the last year or so. The only thing I kind of wish was a bit better, is the character limit.

As a member of a few role-play servers I find myself often constricted by the 2000 character limit, especially considering I tend to write out 10K+ messages in google docs that I then post for characters that I role-play. As I’m sure is obvious, when I do several of these posts an hour the process of copying and pasting fragments of the messages becomes tedious. Not something that I generally hate, because with how wonderful discord servers are, allowing for many channels to be set up in ways that allow role-play servers to set up several settings, the limited characters per message is far outweighed in my preference. But, in a future update, if at all possible, I’m sure I, and the large amount of Novella Role-play members would certainly enjoy and appreciate an extended or unlimited message character limit."
"I’ve been using discord for about 2 years now and recently I’ve been having multiple problems, be it screen share not working as intended and closing my application, over heating problems or discord closing while I’m in other apps. Usually I fixed these problems by just redownloading the app, but just yesterday it wouldn’t even let me open discord after redownloading it and so I thought “maybe it’ll work after I shut down my phone and it that doesn’t work I’ll wait until tomorrow.” Now today the app doesn’t open so I try redownloading it and it still does not open, (by the way when I mean the app doesn’t open, I mean that it gets stuck in a loading type animation and no matter how long I wait it seems to be infinite) so now I’m sitting here writing about the recent problems discord has been having and asking if the developers are even caring about mobile discord or is it really just a case where I should just get a mic and use discord on my pc.

Despite my 3 star score I’ve still used discord for 2 - 3 years and it’s always been working as intended and it’s worked well up until like 8 months ago. Maybe this is just a problem with my phone despite me having an iPhone XS Max, maybe it’s just an iOS side problem, but discord team keep up the work maybe you’ll find a fix.
Thank You"
"So these people were making a discord talent show and when my sister was up she was in the middle of talking and they stopped her. They said “alright have a nice day thank you for coming!” And my sister was so sad. We actually arranged at this certain time to go to a talent show together and I was there to support them so they were gonna tell dad jokes together. So like they’re here calling me just upset and embarrassed sad, and I already reported the discord server. I’m livi#5618 reporting the server and can u please shut it down. Me and my friends weren’t the only one experiencing this bad disrespectful behavior, this guy was complaining about how they kicked his friend out and I heard them kick a lot of people out while they were talking. I’m just thinking: give them some time to talk! I reported livi#5618 that’s me, so I hope u the server I reported as well. I was super mad about it and right now I think they’re kicking out more people. Please shut it down and give them a warning because this behavior is not respectful and for the first time I hate one of these talent shows. I think a lot of people are upset about this to and honestly I’m not gonna accept this. I don’t know if they’re gonna make another one just shut it down please. Thank you!"
"I like Discord for what it offers, but the iOS app crashes randomly whenever I try to load a picture, gif, song, or other upload someone else posted, and crashes when I try to post pictures quite frequently. I know that a lot of people upload stuff, so the fact that it crashes as often as it does is a major concern for me. 

Another issue is that the app has decided to randomly mark all messages in random chat channels as read when I open them, even though I’ve still got dozens to read before I reach the end of the string. Or I’ll be reading the messages, and suddenly it marked all messages as read, to include ones that happen while I’m reading, and not even remotely caught up. It happens randomly, so I don’t even know what might be the issue. It might happen to a chat every time I open it, or just once in a while but it’s a bug I want to see gone. Being tagged in a message, and then having that indicator removed randomly is an issue. I don’t always have time to read everything in one sitting, so I want to be assured that I can read it later. It is a major issue when it starts you over at the end of the conversation, and doesn’t save from where you had to leave off. (This is mostly for my admin duties on servers.)

I like that I have the ability to take Discord with me, but if I can’t use it half the time, then it’s like I don’t even have it at all."
"Discord has been incredible for me, I have been able to talk to and call friends, connect with new people, and it all has been very private and  secure. 
At first, I was a little bit superstitious when it came to discord. It did seem like a very open messaging service, leading to incidents with cyber bullies/child predators. Since getting discord, all of these worries have basically vanished. It is a high quality messaging and calling service (especially for large groups), and it can also serve as a way to meet new people. In my experience, I have stayed on private servers and direct messages with my friends, but I have still gotten a ton of usage out of the app. 
I highly recommend this app to anyone looking for a nice voice calling or messaging service. I would also like to mention to any parents who are nervous to allow their kids to use this to at least give it a chance. If your child stays in groups with just his friends, they will be absolutely safe, and if they do go into a public server, I have found that people are generally very nice. Plus, if you do get into a situation that is uncomfortable, you can simply leave the group or block the caller. 
I hope this helps!"
"Discord is a great app, as I myself have been using it since 2018, and it hasn't given me any problems. However, there are some things I wish Discord had that it currently doesn't. Here's some I could think of:
-In servers it would be great if you could mention a role without the person(s) that have that role being notified (maybe a different prefix, like $).
-If, for example, I want to ping people with a certain assortment of roles, such as Moderators that are online at the moment, or Friends that are also Server Boosters. Some way to combine role pings to capture the attention of a more precise bracket of people would be nice.
-I'm in so many servers that it's extremely difficult to navigate through each of them, even with folders. I really think there should be an option to lower the size of server icons, and a new folder functionality, instead of appearing on the same row as others, servers in open folders would travel to the right of other servers, giving space to be able to see every server and navigate with ease
-Slightly similar to the previous point, but there should be an option to make channel tabs smaller. Same reason."
"I’ve used discord for a very long time, for 5 years and I really enjoyed using it until I my account had gotten disabled because I decided to cancel my 3 month free nitro subscription. I had canceled because I didn’t really have a need for the subscription. I was rarely on and never really used the perks of their nitro. I had canceled my subscription on September 22nd 2021 and didn’t think they were gonna charge me, but I had checked my bank account to find out they did. I waited a few days thinking maybe it was on an accident and they’ll refund me my money but I had seen they didn’t. On September 25th I had put the request for a refund and got approved. As soon as that happened my account was immediately disabled and I wasn’t able to access it anymore. I contacted discord support to see what the reason why and explained what had happened but they insisted that I had broke their terms of service because I didn’t let them charge me for a subscription I had canceled. 
I had some of my best friends on there and was in a lot of really cool communities and it’s an utter shame that I will never be able to communicate with them again because of their poor customer service and api.
Don’t use discord, they’ll disable and ban your account because they have bad api and customer service won’t listen to what you have to say because they feel like it superior to you."
"This app is great! I gave the app a 5 star only so this could be seen, but I truly rate this a 3 But I give it that rating over one thing… THE PHONE NUMBER! Discord randomly asked me to put in my phone number in order to proceed so I did, when I finished that process I went right back over to delete the number because I did not want my number in my account. However when I did press “Remove Phone Number” It took me right back and said “Something’s fishy here, we need your Phone Number” So I realized I had no choice but to keep my Phone Number in my account. So, I put it in once again and then it said “This number can’t be used because it was used recently in another account” I was furious! Discord Devs, you’re not slick, this was basically you guys just saying “We don’t want you to remove your Phone Number, so yeah lol” That’s honestly not cool, you’re forcing people to put in their information they aren’t comfortable putting in! Others have been having this same problem, and some different reason why they don’t want their phone number in their account. This is not cool Discord Devs! Please remove this! Other than that… I love the app!"
"I’ve been using discord for almost a year now and it was chill and fun to use which it still is. I just can’t get over the new font they are using and the way they highlight pings now it’s so gross, and the logo is fine and all but the color is kinda wonky like it just doesn’t fit the theme for discord as well as the other one did. And I get it though they’re trying to make it marketable to tons of other groups (which it already was) but really what’s so wrong with the app being known for gaming? Come on. I still use the app cause it’s my main way of communicating and gaming with my friends but it’s just really throwing me off now. Before the update I would’ve given it a 4-4.5 cause there are quite a bit bugs and I think it’s annoying I can’t send my friends videos and pictures just because it’s a small bit too big, and if I wanted to send them videos of my dogs being cute I’d have to pay 5-14 bucks (because of tax) to do so, but that isn’t too bad. Anyway now because of the annoying fonts and all the bad things I’ve been hearing coming from the new update, I’m giving it a 2 but it’s an in general great app if you wanna meet to new people online and communicate with your friends. I believe this app has a place for EVERYONE, disboard is a common and easy place to find a server for you."
"I love the features, I often rescue kids from the Amino Communities and show them the quality differences for communication. There’s a lot of secret quirks you find out from other users and I think it’s a good way of differentiating newbs to the OGs. However with all of the cool things I’d like to be able to have a few features that I’ve seen in other apps added one day. For instance backgrounds for the channels ((could be nitro feature)) make it easier to submit transparent stickers on Apple mobile. I have to get on the PC site and it’s such a hardship when I have to mess around on the site that isn’t meant to be seen on mobile. And for the censors || || maybe keep people from screenshotting the message after you uncensor it. I’ve seen photo editing apps do it so I’m sure we could squeeze the feature into Discord. ALSO:: can we get rid of the emoji conversion? I’m pretty sure if someone wanted to send an actual emoji they would. Otherwise everyone probs want to stick to the keyboard aesthetic. Over all a sturdy and nice app once you get accustomed to it. As a newb things seem very cluttered and you just have to figure it out on your own :/"
"This app is very very good but has some bugs...

One is if you tap on a msg to dm someone then go to user settings it bugs out and the message typing thing will be at the bottom of the user settings preventing me to access and leave the user settings and forces me to restart the app. Another bug I have with this app is that I’ve noticed whenever I join a call the app constantly makes my phones screen black as if it keeps constantly putting my phone to sleep. And my last problem is that I’m a nitro user and I constantly change my profile every now and then, and when I select the animated profile I want to use it displays it as if it were a normal profile picture and when I go to save it my profile picture won’t update.... I deleted the app and tried again and then it changed so it seems like I have to deleted and reinstall the app just to change my profile picture. 

Nonetheless it’s a pretty nice app if you ignore the problems that it has as they are easy to ignore. The only problem that really bugs me is the blackout screen thing when I’m in a call with my friends my other friends have that problem too and we have no idea if there is a fix for it."
"The app itself is a 10/10, the mechanics are great, i’m able to chat with my friends for hours on end, it was overall an incredible time, UNTIL out of the blue “ your account has been suspended for violations against the discord terms and service”,OK what exactly did I do, “we will be investigating your account”.  I emailed them, A bot responds “ The reason your account was disabled was because you violated the discord terms in service” OK, BUT WHAT DID I DO?????? “ you violated the terms and service”. Needless to say I lost about 20 friends because I can’t speak to them anymore.
In their eyes they see someone who’s completely ignoring their messages, it just won’t let me get in. I tried to log back in, and I had to take the robot verification test eight times before it stopped letting me take the test for “Rate Violations” which basically means you tried getting your password in too many times and now we’re not gonna let you do it anymore. The app itself is great, But be warned, your account might get disabled for no reason what so ever. Discord if you’re reading this (a real person that is) WHY IS MY ACCOUNT DISABLED??????????"
"In short, it's ugly af, and feels incredibly intrusive. The previous ui design was much nicer to look at, and much less in the way and in your face.

Please remove this asap, or change it to something more akin to the previous design. I'm seeing a lot of other people expressing dislike of it, so I hope that will help convince you to change it back.

On a side note: I'm someone who really needs empty space when using things. Not too long ago, Twitter completely updated their website, and in doing so removed a significant amount of empty space which was previously present. Until a plugin was developed to set it back to the previous design, I actually could not use the website. Something similar happened recently with Discord to a lesser extent, specifically with the friends tab. The recent addition of the ""active now"" section removed a lot of the empty space which was previously present, and as a result I can rarely use that tab without needing to look away or click something else immediately. This new update again takes away more empty space with the new ui changes, albeit to a notably lesser extent, but it's enough for it to instill at least some discomfort for me while using Discord."
"My account was hacked and during the two days it was hacked, three Nitro gifted subs were purchased by the hacker. Discord Support helped me get my account back, but even though I mentioned the false purchases when I explained in detail the whole situation, they didn’t pay any mind to that part at all or offer any solution to my financial dilemma. I didn’t know what to do, so I went to my bank provider and decided to get my money back that way. This was apparently against the Terms and Conditions, so they disabled my account. I tried to appeal by explaining the situation again, but all I got was a cookie cutter response that denied my appeal. I tried one more time; this time I offered to undo the chargebacks because the Discord email that informed me of my account being disabled said I could. I just wanted my account back even if it meant giving back money that was wrongfully taken from me in the first place. All I got was the exact same cookie cutter response denying my appeal.
Are bots running Discord Support? There seems to be zero empathy and zero reading of anything I said. From my POV, I’m getting punished by Discord for trying to get my money back that was stolen from me while using Discord. Although, I didn’t go about getting my money back the “right” way, this still doesn’t sit right with me at all. Now I lose my account of 5+ years. What a joke."
"Let me get one thing straight. I love using Discord as a platform for chatting with friends, playing games together, etc. There are a few minor bugs I could do without (the first one that pops into my mind is how if a message is sent almost exactly as I switch to another channel, flipping back to the first channel won’t get rid of the notification unless I switch off it and switch back), but overall, it works fantastically. I especially love being able to search up GIFs on mobile. That was definitely needed.

The only thing I’d request is that the team would bring the Discord app to other platforms; namely, console platforms. Currently, I can’t stream my console gameplay to Voice Channels because I can’t easily access Discord on console. While typing on a console keyboard would be a nightmare and a half, I imagine streaming and voice channels would work beautifully, as that’s exactly how party chats tend to work. I’d be willing to put up with getting out my phone to type quickly in a channel if I could join a Voice Channel and stream to it from my console."
I love this app i would give it a divendres star rating because of all of the amanint features it has but...if you are under the age of 13 this may not be the right app for you. There are mostly no blocks which can be good and bad. But if you are 13 or younger its not the best. Things can get Inapropiat really fast and yes there are blocks and limits but you have to activate most of them and the ones you do not have to activate are for if you PUT in that you are younger that 18 and most young users lie about their age so they have no limits. That may not be a problem for most but for some it can go down hill fast. One more reason i do not give this app five stars is because any one can get it and that is ok with most people but again if you are under 13 that is a big problem because you could be talking to a high school student when you are in elementry school. Or you could even be talking to a 60 year old man/women at the age of 8. Now again this app is a amazing but it could be dangerus for children and has no limits. And i do not want to give a bad revew because this app is great but it is dangrus for children and a play ground for Child predators. But again amazing app
"I have been only using Discord for about 6 months and have loved it too much! I keep it open 24/7 to see what friends are playing and love chatting with them while we play games! I have loved all the fun features that Discord has to offer! You can create a massively public server or a small little server for your gaming peeps! Also, it is so easy to manage the server! Everything is so clear and easy to navigate when you own a server! I love it how you can customize the roles and have other people have higher roles and being in the group of people which everyone is! I love the things that you can do when you don’t even own a server like try and earn respect and climb up the ranks! It is like a little civilization that you are in with a bunch of other people! The settings and security of Discord is great! I love the fact that you can completely secure yourself and only allow messages from people you know or having the freedom to meet people! Plus what I have researched Discord is like unhackable! You can do so many things with Discord that it’s mind blowing! Anyone who is uncertain of getting Discord read above and just get it!"
"Dear discord,

Right now I’m extremely mad and furious, you want to know why you may ask? Well I figure there is a lot of bugs in your app that you may not know of. First I made a discord account that I loved with a group and a lot of a friends, I also was attending groups and having fun until I was wanting to invited people to my group. It showed up a picture saying this “Somethings going on here” it also says this “we’ve detected something out of the ordinary going on. To continue using discord, we will need you to verify you account” so I was like no big deal right? So I did everything. I put in my number, I put in the verification number, until it got down to my password. I was like “oh I know my password in a heart beat. So I put the password in. It was correct to I thought when I hit done it will bring me back to the page with my friend. When I hit done, it brought me to are you a robot thing. So I did the task and I was done so I hit verify. And guess what... I hit done again.. it loaded.. and did nothing. I was having a full panic attack. So I deleted the app and did the whole thing over again. Yes all over again. Same thing happened. So I don’t know if it’s a bug or you guys want people to get so angry. So if u get things please update or do something so you don’t get other people mad to. Thank you..?

-sincerely Audrina"
"…has now become far less so for me.

As a writer by hobby, I love using a Bluetooth keyboard with my iPad, making it easier to type up documents, messages and such without having to lose the tactile effect of a real keyboard. However, the most recent updates to this app, which I used to communicate with a small group of friends, have brought a crushing blow to my enjoyment of it. Up until recently, when using my Bluetooth keyboard, I could hit the “Enter” key to send messages, but now… now it only causes a line break into a new paragraph in a message, which used to be tied to the Shift+Enter combination exclusively. And there is no button in the settings menu of the iOS app to change this.

I could easily forgive if this update aspect had simply swapped the functions of Enter and Shift+Enter, but removing the “Enter to send” functionality entirely? No. This is an absolutely appalling decision on the part of the developers, and I would strongly urge them to change it back, or else give users the option to choose whether to use it or not, and/or to what key or key combination they would rather bind the function. Otherwise, many users who, like me, have developed a muscle memory to hit Enter to send messages will continue to have a problem with what was once a glorious app."
"Perfect on PC, well... the camera mode on PC nearly broke my PC and broke my discord, so I had to delete it. So I used the online version and it does work and so when it was broke on my PC I was trying to fix it but I gave up after a while, so I downloaded it on mobile to be able to talk to my friend because he can’t call or text. So I go on the mobile version of discord and I like to talk to him and the sound is broke. I can hardly hear him, so I turn up the volume, doesn’t work, turn up the discord volume, doesn’t work, and finally I turn up his volume so I can hear him better, (and you wouldn’t guess this) IT DOES NOT WORK. Only then do I find the online, but I do want to play with him when I’m not at my house and I hope it works this time. The only reason I gave it 5 ⭐️’s because it helps me reach my friends that I can’t call or text and it works well when I don’t use the camera, and I could get in contact with online friends that I don’t know irl without giving to much information but I get to talk with them. I hope to get a developer response explaining why I had problems."
"I love Discord, it has helped me in so many ways, gaming, interpersonally, working, I have used it with so many aspects in my life and I probably will continue to use it until my friends and I move on to a different service. I enjoy being able to send an instant message and edit it if I need to add or correct something, I like that it can be personalized with an emoji or the like and servers bring communities together. My only complaint is now with so many updates, gone is the simplicity, gone is the uniqueness of the service and in comes being like everything else. Every update it seems less to do about giving to the users and becoming more about business. And every year incompatibility issues arrise. What’s messed up now? Notifications, Voice Calls disconnecting when trying to multitask or random disconnects, Streaming requiring more and more resources, even Discord itself becoming more of a social media platform than an instant messaging/gaming integrated app. Maybe it’s just me but, personally I don’t exactly like where Discord is headed, and I’ll probably see everyone in the next platform, whatever it may be. The next “Myspace/Facebook”."
"I started to use discord around a year ago, with that said I use it for everything, I own a few gaming teams and it is so nice to communicate with other team members, other teams, etc etc, I also use discord to communicate with friends, teammates ( especially in games where a mic is not supported ) discord does not affect my frames which is something I enjoy, I can still play my favorite games with discord open without sacrificing graphics or frame, I also have a few servers which I moderate and using bot support I can easily put up chat filters to prevent people from using certain words that may be deemed inappropriate, setting discord up was surprisingly easy and I had no trouble what so ever, I have never been let down by discord either, there servers have never been down allowing me to always communicate the quality is purely amazing, for any game devs out there I would use this as this app allowed my favorite developers to host polls, show updates, and even do giveaways, simply put this is the best way of communication for any devs, gamers, or fans, and even friends and would highly suggest that you get this app"
"Hello there ‘Discord’, I hope you’re having a wonderful day. Now, this app has always been amazing. I’ve never really had a problem and to do this day no complaints. Complaints and suggestions, two things often misunderstood. But I am here to say I am not making a complaint. All i suggest is that we have the same options as computer users. I’d like to change my game status on my mobile phone because obviously i’m not able to take my computer just anywhere with me. The games mode isn’t available in the app or web login unless it’s on the computer. It slightly bums me out but since discoed has always been such a great app
i overlook it. I think everyone would be happy if the game status option would be on mobile as well. Playing on the go IS a thing. Why not add it for us too? All in all that is my suggestion, the ability to change my game status on mobile just like in my computer. Yes, I understand that this may take time. But it is worth waiting for and I know you and your team can accomplish it. Thank you for reading and have a great rest of your day.

(If you would like to speak 1 on 1 for any particular reason or questions, my discord is iisabxla#2993)"
"Discord works great on a desktop computer/laptop, other than finding the right chat room and general navigation issues like getting a message noise but never seeing the message because you were in a voice chat room.  Could use a redesign.  Like why isn’t voice just enable in the same chat room so there’s no switching back and forth?

However, this review is for the mobile app.  It doesn’t work.  Every time I do so much as sneeze (another app notification/text message comes in, if I get a phone call, etc.) the app stops working.  I get that the voice should stop but after switching apps and coming back or after ending the phone call, the Discord app never recovers and must be restarted, rejoin the room, and then it works...for a while.  Until almost anything else happens.  Worst of all, when my phone falls asleep, so does Discord, sometimes.  It’s unpredictable when I’m just randomly disconnected from Discord.  My friend reported his phone calls not coming through when he’s on a Discord voice channel. Not sure which problem is worse.

I’d highly recommend using a different app. Often, my friends and I just use a phone conference call.  And I can send a text message while on a phone call. So how does this app improve my gaming other than taking bandwidth from my gaming?"
"My main discord account just magically signed me out and i know the password but it said it didn't work so i register and trembling because i lost all my friends, but then it magically signed me out again, i quit using discord, my account ElliottLian#4141 remains dead and never work, if you read this discord please bring my account back, or saying the token expired because i tried making a new password for my main discord account but it never works and another attempt it said token expired, i keep waiting and finally doesn't say token expired, and when i made a new password for my main discord account and remembered it, i was in a joyful mood, ready to login. But when i did, it just said it didn't work, i put it correctly and never work. I was crying, never meeting my friends I've met a long time ago when i started discord. I miss them, discord ruined my relationships with other people. If your reading this discord, please don’t mess this up for other people, you might ruin their day. Also, if you get a chance to revive my account send me a dm in gmail so i can see. You have ruined all my relationships. Good bye discord, its nice having you for a long time, but its time for me to go to another path of light, where it will never crap itself. Goodbye, Discord."
"As for all of the reviews claiming for this app to be bug filled and laggy, it’s not an issue as of discord itself. It’s a personal user mistake and wifi connectivity problem. I have been using discord for years, about six now, and I have never had an issue with lag or bugs. Even with all of the new updates. 
Only once has the calling been unavailable but that was because discord put it on hold to fix a connectivity issue, since discord calls aren’t the clearest out there.
I would definitely recommend this app to friends and family to keep in contact. I’ve created a whole community on discord and brought many people together, even saved lives. And I’m not being dramatic. This app gives people a way to vent and learn new things, meet new people, make connections.
I met the love of my life on this app and now we live together in person, in our own apartment! I’ve never been more happy. And before you call me some old nerd with a joy for gaming, I’m actually not a gamer, and I’m only 18 years old. (:
I recommend discord! It’s helped me through so much!"
discord is a great app to interact with your friends and I’d loved to give this app 4 stars but I’m giving it 4 due to the voice chat issue the voice chat needs works you have to leave call and come back because something happens and you can’t hear the others or they can’t you. So leaving and coming back is only A temporary fix to the problem but happens multiple times through the call it gets to be annoying. other issues is it at times call cuts out when ppl are talking and you can’t hear what they are saying and they have to repeat their self sometimes  to understand what they are saying. seem to have connection issues so if you improve the voice chat that would be awesome being you talk to ppl all over the world be nice to be able to have a conversation without it cutting out and being able to understand what everyone is saying but when it is actually working it’s so wonderful to get to have a nice Conversation with all your friends. this goes for voice chat and also discord private calling. so if you could please look into this and fix the problem that would wonderful! thank you 😊
"It’s an amazing app! There’s just some things that I hate, like add some mobile updates? The updates you guys add to pc should also head to mobile too. After all, it’s an amazing app I recommend you guys to download it. I have just saw that you guys just made the app 17+, coming from a 15 year old I think you guys should make it back too like to 13+ because people older then 13 have already downloaded it (like me). Also think you should allow us to type more then the limit of 2000 it gets very annoying, for example your gonna write a paragraph for someone and it’s very important and it’s about 5000 word long. Even though it has some issues, very amazing app and I’m always on there for like 8 hours a day to talk with friends and stuff! I’m always making servers In discord, but I think you should really do something about those hyphens and get rid of it so we can have our own fonts to add and watch out for what you do to your app, because people underage are now faking there age and when they were born, I once saw my 8 year old sister in discord! Please watch out."
"My account was hacked 2 weeks ago. Filled out a ticket and was told my case was “escalated to a team member.” After that complete silence. All of my follow up inquiries were completely ignored and did not receive a response when I asked how long the process takes. Malicious bots have always been an issue with discord and now I understand why. The support team does absolutely nothing get the accounts back to their owners and actually allows the bots to run rampant. Extremely disappointing support from probably the largest voice chat service. 

 Edit: sweet. Developer response. Maybe it will be helpful. Oh, nope. Just telling me to go through the same avenues that are already ignoring me. Guess since they recommend to submit a new ticket if you don’t get a response, I’ll have to clog the system with a new ticket every couple hours until someone responds

 Final edit: Rather than transferring control back to me, Discord deleted the account. So bear that in mind before you pay for anything in the app. Customer service will take over 5 weeks to respond, and when they finally do, they will take the absolute shortest route. They will cut corners in order to provide the minimum support required no matter what it costs to us. We do not matter to them at all."
"I’ve noticed that Discord has made an update where: You can change your avatar banner (If you have Nitro). And I wanted to come up with another suggestion, that i’ve been thinking about. I think there should be a feature (this is about the avatar/profile pictures) where you can click on your pfp, when changing it. And have a feature where you will see two tabs, the first one that says: ""Files"" (meaning you can go into your photos from your device and change you pfp, into any picture). And the second tab that says: ""Photos"" (where it shows, what photos you had set as your pfp before, and can scroll through them and find the one that you want to change into again). This makes it easier to find what photos I had as my pfp. Because It’s hard trying to find the photo that I want, when I already had set it as my pfp before. This feature is similar to Googles.  As the banner feature seems to be a bit similar to Youtubes. I hope this does become a feature, because I feel like it’ll be very helpful!"
"Let me start by saying that I’ve used the mobile app before and had no issues previously. However, ever since I switched to my iPad Air 4th gen, I hav heard nothing but problems with the app. For one, I can’t use it while it’s in the background. Before, I could use the app while doing other things, such as using the internet browser. Nowadays, if I leave the app, everything on my end stops working. I can’t hear anyone speaking, my mic doesn’t pick up my voice, nothing works. This problem persists even if I disconnect and reconnect. Most annoyingly this problem will persist even if I restart the app. The only solution I’ve found is to restart the entire tablet.

The above is already problem enough but I figured if I just stay on the app without leaving, I wouldn’t have the same issues. Nope, I still encounter the above issues after a certain amount of time with no reason for it. The only reason I’m not sure if it’s discord or my iPad Air is that I don’t encounter these same problems on a different iPad. It’s only on my iPad Air do these problems occur. But I have tried everything from updating both the app and the iPad, to deleting the app and reinstalling. Nothing has worked and I’m stuck with the problems."
"It’s actually a really good app but once I accidentally Unfriended someone and couldn’t send them request again cause I did not know their tag number , I wish we could see our Unfriended people list but I can’t even when I got the discord data package I even tried emailing the support team but they did not even reply to emails, and still I try to contact that person who is very important to me but I don’t get any response because I know that person always uses discord but yea.... Or instead of showing the unfriended people list I wish we could just search the user or a feel letters of a user and then there could be a lot of users with tag numbers instead of user name and tags number to send that person a friend request but when you search some person up any user with the similar name it still doesn’t show up , and you can’t even have your own profile so others can see who you are and if they want to send a friend request. Id anyone knows anything about the user Superskillz or I think superskills please let me know send me a friend request in discord UnicornLady#0248 thanks bye"
"I’ve been using Discord for about a year and half now, the app for maybe a year. They’re been a lot of improvements since then that I was happy to see. The CallKit was definitely not one of them. I wish there was an option to at least disable it. I don’t like my Discord calls showing up in my history. I don’t like Discord calls ringing on my phone like a normal call. 
Also, I’ve had a lot of audio problems since it was added. My alarm goes off? Can’t hear or talk anymore, have to leave and rejoin the call. Someone calls my phone? I can’t just mute my mic and answer anymore. I have to hang up. And even if I decline the call? Audio problems. Can’t hear. I also hardly ever get proper notifications anymore. People send me messages, but I don’t realize I get them because the sound doesn’t go off while I’m in a call. A few times I just never got a notification at all. And I’ve missed a lot of calls because Discord never rang. 
I actually like the new update that lets you choose whether or not to use speaker. I was sad to see the option go, so I’m glad it’s back. Wish speaker was default though. Still, it’s nice to have the option."
"I have relied on Discord for my game clan’s chat outside of the game. It’s been a nice, stable platform over the years, so I’m very happy with its stability.
.....  I do have some complaints, though.  It is so hard for me to figure out how to do almost anything!  Over the years, the developers have made numerous updates... but never, it seems, toward making basic functions more user-friendly. It’s as if they cannot believe anyone would not find the learning curve a joy.
..... I realize that I am slower than a lot of people to learn things with computer programs. But I also notice that no one in our group, if they do know how to do something, has ever found it easy to explain how to do it to others.
...... And there are some very basic things that NO ONE in my 30 member group can figure out. How do we create a new room within our channel? Shouldn’t this be as simple as adding a new folder in a file system? We’ve been using Discord over 3 years, yet no current member can figure out how to do this.
.....  In terms of ease of use, Discord is a mess. I have to deduct 2 stars for that reason alone. I would give 5 stars if things were reasonably easy to learn."
"This app/service is incredible. It’s aloud me to communicate with people without pumping up the phone bill. It lets me communicate with groups of people and meet new people that I never would have. I love this app. The servers, the (majority of) people, the bots, all of it. Now here’s the but (This is just a single bug though so don’t be scared out of getting this app because of what your about to read, it’s truly worth the (free) buy.) Recently, I’ve been having a particularly annoying issue with discord on iPhone. I don’t know if it’s on any other devices or types of devices but it’s at the very least happening to me. When in calls, the screen on my phone will shut off for a time between 2 and 30 seconds. This happens at random intervals and seems to happen less (though still) the further I get into a call. Even when outside of the discord app with the call going in the background, the screen can still shut off. This is my *sole* issue with this app however. If you don’t have discord, get it. Can’t recommend it enough!"
"Discord is a great alternative to other apps, I got it because I was in a group and that group required you having Discord, and at first it was really complicated but then I got a hang of things. The problem started randomly, what would happen is whenever I open Discord it goes completely black, like the first time this happened I literally thought my IPad died, but nope. I closed the application, and on the screen, it showed “discord” but the app screen was almost empty discord was going very faint, and I can’t do anything on discord, I deleted it and reinstalled it multiple times. Still, nothing changed, idk what to do now, because when my clan is hosting a training or a patrol to get promoted, we NEED to be in Voice Chat. This has been limiting my ability to be a active member in my clan, the only way I can use Voice Chat or chat or other servers is by using my phone. But using a iPad to play games, and a phone to communicate is really hard. Other than this I have had no problems whatsoever. This would have been a five star but this issue has made things VERY difficult. Please Help."
"All in all, it's a great app.  In fact, I'd say it's nearly perfect on PC.  However, there are some features on PC that you can just not access on mobile.  For example, you can't change privacy settings to turn off DMs on a certain server, which can be a struggle for people with, uh, fans.  Another thing is that you can't change somebody's role on mobile, which is very aggravating. I'm a moderator on a server and we have a specific role to give to misbehaving people which prevents them from sending messages.  But, I can only do my job as moderator if I'm on my PC, because mobile won't let me change roles.  In addition, for whatever reason, certain pictures refuse to upload, and it’s not the channel settings because it’s only with certain pictures (only on mobile).  The last thing I recommend, which is currently neither on mobile or PC, is having some version of read receipts for DMs.  I know that's probably gonna be controversial, but I personally know that some of my friends are big YouTubers, so they get caught up, and forget.  However, if I was able to tell if they'd read my message, I'd be able to yell at — er, uh, talk to them about it."
"Out of all of the social media platforms I’ve tried, discord I would say is the most toxic of them. 
And it’s not because the employees and staff working at discord are mean, or anything, it’s because of the nature of the setup discord chooses to use. Essentially when you join a server, the guidelines you have are the ones the owner sets for you. Larger servers are often governed by mods. But the problem is that these mods generally don’t have too many qualifications to be a moderator. And when the mods are ineffective at creating a safe environment, that’s when toxic behavior thrives. Discord does have some policies, on its ToS but these are generally very simple rules, and are few and far between. I’ve had many terrible experiences on servers where toxic behavior is present and the mods either do nothing about it or they take the wrong course of action. Now this isn’t something discord has much control over, but rather design of the website in it’s entirety is flawed. I wouldn’t recommend this app to people who who are not in a healthy state of mind, or to anyone in general. However I guess discord works for some people and if you find that this style of social media works for you then by all means download it. But do be prepared for possible toxic behavior thrown your way."
"I absolutely love this app. Finding a gaming partner is way easier using this! I’ve actually found a group of people that I frequently game with and talk to that I honestly really love. My experience this past year has been really amazing, and without trouble. However, only one thing really annoyed me in my time using discord. When you want to leave a server you’ve created, you have the option to pass ownership to someone you trust or someone that’s qualified. It isn’t the same for group chats, though. If I had created a group chat, and had to leave, I would also want to pass the ability of owner to someone trusted, but it randomly picks a member to make the new owner. As the owner, I think I should be the one making that choice. Because even though I absolutely love my discord friends, some of them tend to abuse the power of owner chaotically, and I don’t want to be added back into that kind of environment. Leaving a group chat you and wanting to be added back soon just leads to you crossing your fingers and hoping someone worthy got the crown."
"I use Discord every single day on PC and have never encountered noticeable glitches, but the Discord app is getting on my last nerve. The app has had this glitch where the send button suddenly doesn’t work anymore. It’s not just the send button, but the emoji tab won’t work either. You can still type and even scroll left to right and see your DM info and server list, but all of the buttons freeze up and don’t work. I literally have to copy my message, fully close out of the app 2 or 3 times, deleting the half saved DM still remaining in the text bubble each time I reopen, and then finally, usually after the 3rd time, it will be functioning again and I’ll have to paste and send my message. I’m writing this after having gone through that process just for my phone to lose what I had copied, not giving me the option to paste, losing everything I had typed. This glitch has me asking my friends to download different apps because we’re all getting so frustrated with it while trying to communicate during work or school hours. Y’all have a LOT of money, I know you can do better and fix it."
"This app is great if you want to message your friends, make calls and have a blast but their is still some issues I would like to be fixed. Discord lost a bit of popularity since the update. The issues I find most annoying is when you are trying to delete messages in a DM you have to go through each individual message and press delete. Instead of just deleting all messages at once, you have to scroll for hours deleting thousands of messages. Knowing you could just put a button to delete all, instead you made everyone suffer by deleting each message. I want to delete all my messages on a DM with a friend and it’s taking too long. Nobody wants to sit here for hours deleting messages when you could literally just click one button, taking less than 5 minutes. Think how easier and happier customers will be with 5 minutes, because nobody wants to delete messages for atleast an hour. Think this through, and please, fix this. I love discord, but at this state mind as well use messages."
"What can I say about Discord? I started using it a year or so ago off of a friends recommendation, and I have no interest in going back to any of the multiple VOIP programs I’ve used in the past (Xfire, Skype, C3, Steam, Mumble, Teamspeak, Razer Comms); Discord beats out all of those for one major reason: Absolute control over everything. The ability to create and manage my own channel with access to just about every detail keeps me coming back, and makes things so much easier on me. Volume sliders on everybody giving me peace of mind on how loud (or quiet) people are being, being able to voice/text mute people that are being abusive in chat, and having multiple text/voice channels is just icing on the cake.

I told myself I wouldn’t write a review for Discord till they rolled out with the video call/screenshare update on PC, and they did so here I am. 

If you’re wanting a reliable, free, all-access VOIP program for your gaming or chatting needs, Discord is for you. With their optional Discord Nitro subscription offer I hope they never run out of money to support this gem."
"Don't get me wrong, this is a great app. However, I highly doubt discord knows how to manage passwords. So I wanted to make a new account and use the same email address from my old account. So I try to do this, and I already know discord loves to shove verification down my throat. So I'm like ""ok this should be quick,"" and oh boy was I wrong. So I put in my email address and my password, but it gets declined. So I'm like  ""that's weird, I coulda sworn I typed it in right,"" so I try again. Doesn't work. So I try to use my yahoo account I've had for at least five years. Password is declined. I have never in my life had problems with my yahoo password so I just think ""ok let me just try my phone""
And I do that and try to put in my discord password (which I had next to me on some paper) and it was declined. Now I can't access discord. And if discord wants to respond to this, don't give me that ""Aw shinkledinks, it looks like a Springle has a rough day and doesn't have enough magic powder to snort"" that you are sadly infamous for. Like, at least allow me to view my password in letters or numbers at least. I would love an update where signing into discord isn't a multi-hour ordeal"
"I love discord, I use it everyday but since the recent update that changed the mobile layout it’s become very glitchy and made the app worse overall. PC discord is amazing and I rarely  have issues with it but mobile I have had 3 main problems.
1. Sometimes when I have notifications set to pc it goes to my phone and only my phone
2. I have had many glitches with mobile in the layout. Sometimes when I open discord the layout will be all screwey with the buttons in the wrong places. Other times it won’t show I send messages and sometimes the send button won’t even show up
3. This isn’t a glitch but a design that should change. On mobile I am not able to move text channels or voice channels and it gets very annoying having to go to my pc every time I want to change the layout of my server. Sometimes when I move roles they won’t move and the layout gets all glitchy. 
These are the main problems I have with discord and if they would change the layout back to default keyboard for the phone I doubt these problems will be there."
"This app logged me out several times and it won’t let me log in no matter how many accounts I make. It logged me out, but I already saved my acc password and user, so I tried using that. It failed saying that the email was not registered so I thought “oh it’s no big deal I can just try registering again with the same email cause it says the email is apparently ‘not registered’ yet” so I did that and THEN sit said that the email was ‘already registered’. Okay WHAT?! So I tried creating an acc again, it failed. I tried signing back IN again, still a fail. And I know it’s not my technology glitching our non kyle and that it’s apps fault bc no matter how many devices I tried to switch to, it still wouldn’t work. I used to like this app a bit before this stuff started happened cause this app is really good for like if your friend dosent have a phone and can only text on pc or something like that and it’s also good for gaming and streaming I guess but if you keep getting logged out, there’s no point of giving the app a good review, especially if your like me and have been downloading and deleting the app several times with no success and have literally been trying this for over 4 DAYS STRAIGHT!!!! The developer(s) should really fix this problem before it gets a lot more bad reviews due to this glitch."
"Heya! I just wanna say I love using Discord especially on mobile devices when I don’t have a laptop, and it’s quite a fun app to chat with others.  However, there are some things that I want to have Discord improve on or at least try to help with the app to make it better, especially for mobile devices.  One thing in particular is to have more color choices for roles and to customize role colors on mobile devices.  Another thing is when I see some people’s status when it says something like “Playing Sleeping”, “Playing And 3...2...1..”, etc, I want that option to be available to mobile devices, or if that is already available, please respond to me with how I would do that.  One last thing is when I try to save a picture with a transparent background, when I go look at it in my photos, it doesn’t go from a white background to taping to a black background. I really would like these issues to be fixed in the next update or two.  Other than that, this app is very great and I love how it is improving but by bit! Keep up the great work!"
"Discord is an awesome way to stay in touch with friends, as well as make new ones. It’s basically like iMessaging but it offers a calling system as well. I personally love this app and I’ve been using it for about a year now. You can do some exploring and find servers that you like and/or find new interests! As an example I took up knitting as an inspiration to make a gift for an online friend. 
Though Discord does have safety and privacy settings, it is wise to keep your personal information to yourself while talking with online friends. Discord will not leak your information to any of your friends or anyone at all, so it’s entirely up to you if you want to share anything (such as time zones). I don’t recommend sharing personal information, especially when you’ve just met them. Be careful when messaging unknown users.
Again, I love Discord and would definitely recommend it. If you aren’t at least 13, I don’t recommend reaching out to unknown users other than the accounts made by your friends."
"I've been using discord since early 2016 & absolutely loved it, but the decisions made during 2019 have left me very unimpressed with the staff's lack professionalism when handling serious issues. I was completely unable to use the app or the desktop version due to the April fool's ""joke"" they decided to pull that completely removed their entire platform's functionality from disabled users, including myself. I sent emails to support only to be greeted with replies of the support staff flat out lying to me about the ""prank"" being a permanent redesign for the platform after I told them that I could no longer use it due to a disability. Luckily it was reverted back, but rather than actually addressing the seriousness of the situation, the team behind Discord's social media played along with people complaining about bringing light mode back. The newest update the Apple version received is just not exactly very functional for most users, options that were once quick to access have been moved to a separate menu & you need to go through that menu to even change your profile's online status. It's just extremely unpractical for most users & the way it's designed & functions just doesn't make much sense."
"So i’ve been using discord so about 3 years now and it’s such an amazing app, I use it almost every single day, It’s a great way to talk to friends. But I recently got nitro to use stickers cause I think the stickers are cute, but it’s making me so frustrated, I want to have access to more stickers from a discord server but I only have access to like 15 of them, I thought it was normal at first but my friend has 10x more stickers than I do, I thought i needed to get rid of other stickers so I looked up how to get rid of the standard stickers and couldn’t find anything so i’m guessing i can’t get rid of those, But I do REALLY want more access to more stickers from discord servers, I also made my OWN server so I could use my own stickers and I can’t even use those! :( It’s kind of making me upset because I wasted my name getting Nitro just for me not to get what I wanted! If that gets fixed or if someone FINALLY tells me what is wrong with my stickers or how to get more of them, I’d definitely give this app a 5! I love this app so much and I have some of the most amazing friends on there, but this is my only complaint :)"
"Okay, so, I'm mostly writing this review to address a bug(?)that has made a couple things very difficult.
 
 So, I don't really know when it started, but for a while now, when I try to change my profile picture or set a server profile picture, it takes me to this weird place with the picture in the middle of a black void and the words: Hold and Zoom (I think, I have poor memory so that's probably not exactly what it says) And that's fine, except for the fact that when I press the button to set the picture as my profile, it zooms in very close on this *one* spot no matter what I do, completely excluding the rest of the picture.

 I'm not sure if it's a bug, but now, just to change my profile picture, I have to send the picture to my computer, download it from my email, and then set it as my picture, it's pretty annoying, especially since my computer isn't the best and takes a little while just to start up, and then I have to get to my email, which also takes a while to load.

I hope this doesn't seem entitled, but it would be very nice if this could be fixed or changed so that it would be easier to change a profile picture. (Especially for someone like me, because I'm constantly changing my picture)

Other than that, discord is a very easy to use app, and it lets me find people to make friends with very easily! I recommend it if you don't have a phone and would like to be able to chat with other people online."
"I love discord! It’s an awesome and funny app, and it’s great for quarantine (this review was made in 2020, where there was a pandemic, just an fyi if you are from the future lol) if you are really bored. I found a few bugs though, today I was getting more waifus for my harem (don’t judge pls XD) and the pictures showed up late. I shared that server with my sister, and she said it was doing it for her too. She went to go see if it was doing it for all of the servers, so we checked our owo testing server and the gifs showed up late too. We checked our server with our friends, dank memers memes showed late too. Another bug I found was that when me and my friend call, sometimes one of us can’t hear the other. Like, she asked me if I wanted to play a song with the Rhythm bot, and I kept saying yes to her, but she couldn’t hear it and kept asking me. Another time is actually while I was writing this review and she was talking to me and suddenly it was silent, and then I heard her again. Please try and fix these bugs! This is a great app though! If you read this, GET THIS APP!!!"
"I first got it, and I immediately fell in love with it, I became apart of a close knit server and worked my way up to a moderator, it was amazing until it didn’t. Things began to get toxic and lots of feelings were hurt. I can’t even begin to account for all of the times I’ve been cyber bullied on discord, it really sucked. I even started my own server but soon everyone in it began to hate me and tore it to shreds. All of my hours of hard work and dedication came to an end as I decided to delete my account because I could no longer handle the toxicity. 14 days passed, it’s finally gone, I’m finally free. So many bad memories correlate with the app and I know it’s the same for many other people. It’s not the apps fault, no, but it partly is for allowing bullying and harassment. It’s mostly the people who use discord’s fault yet it’s still correlated with the app. When I saw that discord was being advertised as judgement free I broke down because it was the most toxic app I’ve ever had and contained some of the most rudest and meanest and toxic people I have ever talked to. I would like to say more about my experience but I fear its 2 am and I need to sleep."
"Well, i love it and im basically on it 24/7. But i think the app’s age range should be down to 10. Why? Because kids dont care about age. If they are mature enough, then can get apps they want. Kids flood discord. And theres nothing wrong with it if they are mature enough. Age is a number and i know discord can have some servers that are a but explicit. But. The amount of kids knowing and learning stuff early is high and more kids are maturing too teenager level. Im thinking 10+ would be a great range for the app if children are responsible enough. Ive had this app for 3 or 4 years and i love it. I make so many friends. Younger and older! And there really isnt anything wrong with that. Kids need to be careful though. There could be kid settings too. Where they can only add people and join certain servers. So many kids use discord too. So it isnt a big deal. Coming from me, being 14, ive met people from ages 9 and up. I even found a lover. The app is great just lowering the age range would be a epic change!"
"Old Discord was so much better honestly. Less lag and more privacy when in a call and your phone was locked and didn't show you in a call. Discord bugs out calls so often when you try and join back in a call with someone and still says connecting until both of you guys restart the call. I understand new layout and everything is great, but if you actually fix any bugs and issues, that be great too, and please bring back old Discord from few months prior where we actually HAD our privacy in a call not being shown on our lock screen. It makes it hard because power button can also make you leave the call which is even more annoying and because you can leave the call accidentally by pressing or tapping on your earbuds which is mildly irritating.

Apparently you fixed that issue lock screen issue apparently few days or a week ago now. Thank you, but others issues would be nice please because I really do enjoy your app, but it irritates me when I often complain how there's still bugs when it comes to calls and text not working while in a call sometimes until you reset Discord"
"Every update, they break a function further or create new inconsistent and broken functions of things that worked since the app launched. Images unable to be held to bring up menus, emotes won’t work unless you type them manually, app will randomly close because it’s thinking too hard about swapping to a server you tapped on, lag in loading images, lag in uploading images, sometimes it’s instant sometimes it takes eight years for something smaller than you posted moments prior. Reinstalling does nothing. I wish I could go back ten versions at least. This app is a necessary evil, but it’s becoming no more obnoxious than Messenger. EDIT: Got a reply from Dev, so I’d like to note it’s on two different iPhones with updated iOS regardless of data or WiFi having these issues. It’s has to be something client side. I’ve tried reinstalling the app multiple times. No fix. Specifically for the tap and hold on images, it’s explicitly images but standard text is fine on both devices. The only platform I haven’t tried it on is iPad. As for contacting your support, unfortunately I find your support threads to be fairly useless and take a long time to reply. Looking forward to your next update. 😬"
"I love Discord. It’s really addicting, especially with the bots. I can easily talk to my friends on it, voice chat, and even find new people that share the same interests as me. While some people complain at the fact that some bots cost money to gain full access to, I don’t mind. I mean, they have to find some way to fund it and make money, right? Discord didn’t even make the bots. Discord Nitro is the only way Discord has to support itself, so people should really be more grateful that they aren’t required to use it and that they don’t have to spend every minute closing an ad. Discord is one of the only add free apps that I can use, so I appreciate that also.

The only problem I have with the app is when I’m in it, it will sometimes exit me out randomly. While this isn’t a problem since I can just go back into it, it gets annoying at times. I would love if you could fix that. :)

Overall, this is a great app. I don’t see anything Discord could improve on besides the bugs, so I rate it a 5/5 easy to use app."
"Sometimes I love Discord. The audio quality is much better than normal phone calls and it’s a great way to text my friends aside from Snapchat and iMessage. But a lot of the time it either doesn’t work and I can’t hear who I’m on the phone with, or today for example it won’t connect at all. It’s actually making me very anxious because there may be something important on Discord. In my opinion this is a very poorly made app, I think that if you’re going to take the time and pay the money to create an app as popular as Discord then you should at least make it effective. I looked online and apparently sometimes Discord can be “down” (Which is bizarre. I’ve had it with Snapchat too.) which is very disappointing to me. In my opinion these apps should never go “down”. iMessage is never down, so why are these? It boggles my mind sometimes how poorly made this app is. And no I won’t delete it because I use it often. But I am very strongly requesting a major improvement, because this isn’t working. This is bad. Somebody really needs to get to fixing it. If your apps are “down” that is a major issue, because you’re the ones making the app not us and our use of the app is on our time and not yours. Thank you."
"Hi! I’m a person who uses discord on mobile, and I feel like there are a lot of features pc and computer users have that mobile users don’t. Great app in everything else though. Not to offend anyone. Just a suggestion if it’s not being done already: could y’all possibly pass on some features from pc and computer to mobile? For example, I’ve heard of something along the lines of streamer mode on a server I’m in that can only be accessed on pc I think, plus there’s the really really dark version of dark mode which idk how the hecc im meant to access that- anyways back to the point, could there be some features from pc that are added to mobile? It would help a bunch because there are so many differences from mobile discord to pc that it feels like mobile is kind of limited with features. Not to be rude to anyone on the discord.. development team? Whatever it’s called, I know y’all are probably hard at work on stuff sorry if I’m bugging ya. :3"
"I’ve been using discord for several years, but every update seems to make the app worse. I see very few people in the reviews actually liking the IOS integrated calling. Please, for the sake of your dedicated user base, reverse it or make it optional. I cannot stand the fact that I cannot lock my phone during a call. Not to mention the constant cutting out during voice calls and connection issues. (Which have just gotten worse, may I add) It’s so bad that me and my boyfriend have considered switching apps. This is ridiculous. If I wanted to have a phone call where I couldn’t lock my phone and the screen goes black when my hand covers the top of my phone, I would have just used the regular iPhone calling system. Fix. This. Or risk losing business. This is turning into Skype and I left that platform for very similar reasons. Love this app but hate what you are doing to it. Really have hope that you will fix these issues and understand that people don’t like the integrated calling system.

UPDATE: Thank you, discord, for fixing your app. Appreciate it!"
"We just switched to Discord from Slack at my job and I cannot express in words how frustrating of a process this has been. Registering for Discord was a NIGHTMARE. The first invitation link I received was expired despite opening it within minutes of receiving it. It took 3 tries to even get one that wasn’t expired. After I finally got in to set it up, it wouldn’t take my birthday. I would enter it and it would disappear after the menu collapsed. After a few days of trying to figure it out, I got in. After that, I tried sharing a photo that I took on my iPhone (HEIC file) but it doesn’t just show the photo like Slack, Twitter, Facebook, or literally any other site like this would. It posts it as a file and when you click on the file in Discord, it opens a web browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.) and forced downloads the file to your device, all before you even have a chance to view it. This is insanely inefficient, especially for a job that relies on the sharing of photographs. Additionally, it shows that Discord as a software is too weak to handle everything that most softwares can handle on their own. Step it up Discord."
"So I’ve had this app for years and I used to not use it until close to the end of 2020. Now the issue is not the function or anything for me, it’s the fact that I’ve been trying to send I long video to my friend cause it’s his birthday where he is from, so I made a video for him that it over a minute long. Now the app is telling me to get this boost thing and when I click for more info, I get taken to where there are payments. I’ve clicked two versions, one for 9.99 and one for 4.99 and both have said that there was an error. Now I don’t know what error that would be but please the creators of this app, if you say there’s in app purchases available; please make sure the users are able to make a purchase or better explain what we need to do to make that purchase. I like the app and I like that I’m able to someone who is from a different country but I hate that I can’t send a video to him that took me two hours to make. That might not seem like a lot of time but it was for me. So please if someone can contact t me about this, that would be lovely. Have a lovely day/night."
"This latest update has caused the app to awkwardly lag at points. Especially when it comes to trying to use discord emojis. I find myself accidentally sending my message before it even registers that I’ve clicked on what emoji I want. I’ve never had this happen before, and though it doesn’t seem like much of an issue, it also goes for typing as well. It’s like I completely miss letters, and it just doesn’t register that I’m tapping on them. This doesn’t happen anywhere else, and I haven’t had any problems with my phone otherwise.
Also I’d really prefer it if autocorrect went back to the way it was, where you could send things and not have it change after pressing send. The last word becomes drastically changed way too often, and it’s especially annoying when I’m trying to catch a pokemon and it no longer sends what I type and instead what autocorrect thinks I’m trying to say. Maybe this doesn’t pose as a huge deal to others, but I really do hope you’ll reconsider forcing autocorrect when pressing send. I’ve become so used to it not doing it that it now bugs the heckers out of me.
Other than that, I love discord 👍🏻"
"Yet another update that doesn’t allow us to turn off the awful custom discord notifications and force the use of the superior-in-every-way built in system notifications. Why force us to wait a minute or more before these kick in? That’s basically asking “how many minutes worth of notifications would you like to miss” during the most important time to not miss notifications—when the user is switching between apps frequently. The built in notifications are ugly, provide no additional functionality, and disappear into the either if you are in the middle of typing something and can’t click the notification the instant it comes in. I’m sure you guys had good intentions with these notifications (like, the web app), but in iOS, iPadOS and macOS, there are built in notifications that work much better.

In the very least add a “instant” option for the switchover. So the moment I leave discord I get system notifications and don’t miss anything. And if you really can’t let go of the discord notifications, let us enable system notifications along side the discord ones. Getting two notifications overlapping is better than missing them."
Hi my name is Malay and I love this app let me tell you about it and how I got this app and found out about it so one day i  was playing candy crush and alway an app popping up so I saw this and how many pleople found love and made freinds so I downloaded this app and boy was it a dream come ture I created my account for this app and I started going into some chats and when I found the love of my dream his name is chad he was 19. Like me and looking for love I’d just thought he was the love of my life we talked for about. 3 hours and we had the same thing in common I started to ask are you single but he asked me first...and I said AM I heck to the yes yes yes so affter he said let’s meet up in real life or discord I wanted to do in real life but I don’t wanna let him Konw where I live and btw this is a stanger I never met before and I Konw we talked for hours but I don’t konw it he’s a phoyc so I said discord oh boy we had a ball he was the pertty  he said he had to go eat dinner affter he left 10 mits later affter 6:00 he was online then we started to talk again I love this app affter a few years we started to talk more often and met up and had kids Don’t be scared to find love it’s your choice I love this app this is my rating bye
"Okay. Let me just state that I love discord upfront. I’ve used the app daily for over 2 years now and overall it’s so much better than things like Skype and I’ve met many new friends. However, the most recent update released today (May 11,2019) there are some things I just really dislike a lot. 
First off, they moved the search button feature and I used that a lot so now I accidentally start calls and would really prefer (at the very least) the option to move it back. 
Second, calls now come up as an actual phone call and show in recent phone logs. It also opens a new tab that is uncloseable and seems to be always on “connecting...” even though I can hear my friend and my friend can hear me clearly. I can’t close this secondary “phone” tab without ending the call and it’s really frustrating and I’m really hoping you guys will revert the call settings to how it used to be. 
On another note, just a mild annoyance, when calls now start, it automatically plays audio on speaker and I wish there was a way to switch it to the private call setting. 
Hope these issues get fixed, otherwise I’ll have to take a break from using such a great app."
"Discord is an amazing app, and I love it. But the mobile version is missing quite a few important features. For example, Discord on mobile (possibly IOS only) doesn't have Audit Logs for server moderation. Audit Logs are very important for server moderation, so that is one flaw with the mobile app. Also, only a minor setback this is, is the fact that there is no emote button on the mobile app. Yes, you can easily tap the emoji button on your keyboard, but if you are in a server with global emotes, you have to type out the names of the emote. But, there is emote prediction, making this a minor set back. Finally, I want to mention this weird bug that happens sometimes; It is a bug when you can't join Voice Channels or Voice Calls; it just disconnects you automatically, and it does this for a loop. When you close the app and retry, the same results will happen. You usually have to wait hours before you can join a Voice Channel or Voice Call again. Thank you for making such a wonderful app! These setbacks can be overlooked, so Discord is STILL my main way of contacting friends."
"So I’ve had it for around 6 months or so, and there was no problems, it was great! But around at mid-Jan I got banned, and I wasn’t really sure why either. So you know I asked about them on gmail but they just said they will look into it. A month or so later I find my account deleted. And even though I only had discord for 8 months, I had over 50 friends, I spent a lot of time messaging them, and now I can’t. I have no other way of contacting them. So you know I tried to get over it and made a new account. And I made a few friends, but of course I got banned. It said I got banned because I was being “abusive”, I gotta admit, my humor isn’t the best it has a few suicidal jokes here and there, BUT THEY ARE NOT TOWARDS ANYONE AND MAINLY ABOUT ME. I didn’t think I would get banned again, and the only place I did those jokes were through DMS. And if you aren’t Daimler with that word it means direct messages. Meaning they looked through my direct messages, which I’m pretty sure is illegal. And I am a minor so I don’t work and cannot afford to sue discord. Now I have made a new account, I will update on the account in a month. Hopefully I don’t get banned, again."
"I really like discord because I’ve made so much friends during these hard times and it keeps me busy whenever I’m bored. I get to message people that have the same interest as I do. But discord in these past view months has been awful. First it starts out with oversimplifying the logo, changing the fonts and colors. Then it’s the live stage thing, tbh I don’t see a point in this and I don’t see nobody use them but I don’t really have an issue with it because I don’t use this “feature” anyways. And now there is threads on discord and no surprise it’s trying to copy other platforms. With threads I see no point in because discord isn’t used to archive things. It’s used to chat with people online and make some online friends. These changes in my opinion are really bad and unnecessary and these changes is why I’m not giving it 5 stars. Don’t get me wrong discord is a great app to use but those 3 changes are ruining discord. But if you just want to make some friends and chat with people use this app. It’s really fun and easy to use."
so i had a 5 year old account that i had all my friends added on and lost all of it because i upgraded my phone i had two factor authentication on because i was hacked before so i didn’t want it to happen again but when i got my new phone i had all of my data except for my 2FA codes which was okay because there is a way to backup your account without one if you had your phone number linked to the account which i did but they removed the option to do that for whatever reason so i lost a account that i spent 800 dollars on roughly for yearly nitro subscriptions and all of my badges gone to waste now i don’t chat on it a lot i use discord for things like dank memer i love those mini games on servers but i had just lost 5-8 years of progress and then i get banned for saying that i’m on a alt account UNTIL i can get my account back and i made a appeal but it was denied it seriously got denied for absolutely no reason if you’re going to use 2FA make sure to take a screenshot of all the backup codes and write them on paper or something just in case
"#I💙Discord
Hello Discord Developers & Future Discord Customers. I would say I highly Recommend Discord for Gamers, Streamers, and more. You can create a Group with different Channels while Group Owners Get To Download and Program Bots That can Moderate the Chat/Voice Channels.

For Discord Developers
Amazing Job with all the Features and of course creating the app. I would want it to switch everything to subscriptions so then it’s free but you can upgrade to a Premium Member for $5.99 Per 3 Months and they get access to Emojis Created by Discord, Access To Sharing Nature Sounds (Frogs, Birds, Etc...), and they can create Premium Channels which allows channel members to Like, Favorite, and/or Dislike a Message and a Special Bot That the Channel Owner can add. I also want a Membership Called ‘Star Streamer’ which allows the Streamer to Sell Merch and Donations, Use Special Animations on a Avatar (e.g. Dance, Floss, Dab, Etc...), and to add share Videos where they can Name, Describe, and Monetize with a Tip Jar+LeaderBoard where Channel Members can Donate. So kind of a Twitch/Youtube thing."
"I remember the first time I joined discord 5 years ago right when it was starting up. I remember talking to my friends and making new ones on voice calls. I remember being able to just enjoy who I was and play around in servers. I remember when it was a small community, before discord nitro was even a thing. I remember the good old days and have fond memories of those good times I spent with friends.
I’ve seen many friends come and go, and I’ve stayed with discord as a reliable way to make new connections and connect with my friends. I miss the long nights I would spend on discord, browsing through servers and hopping into VCs. I miss the times when I said goodbye to a lot of my close friends for good.
I will always love discord. It’s been a huge thing for me to be able to connect with people and learn new things. I learned about my own life and what I want to be when I become older. I learned that it’s ok to love yourself and who you are.
I love Discord. From the bottom of my heart. Thank you for your wonderful service."
"Discord is generally a good app that I use frequently to chat with friends. However, recently with the new updates, I’ve noticed quality in calls drop. Granted, the calls were never super great for me, but unlike before, it would consistently mute my friends so that I would have to leave and rejoin, then it’d work. Not only that, but my friends would often cut out several times during call. It could be a network issue and I’m sure this isn’t 100% discord’s fault, however it’s been frequent and annoying at times. Another issue I’ve been experiencing is really annoying. For some reason, discord has completely stopped working at random intervals. What I mean is that even though I get notifications, when I try to launch the app, the loading glitches and I’m forced out. The only way to fix this to my knowledge is deleting the app and downloading it again. It is happening more and more frequently and is an issue I’ve experienced ever since the latest update
Other than that, discord is great. It’s an easy app to use to chat with friends and I would give it a higher rating if not for the issues I stated."
"I’ve been using Discord since 2017, and I stand by it as the best public & private multi-platform media option around. However, at least in the past few weeks, I’ve noticed an extremely frustrating glitch that is only happening on my iOS devices, where the screen just doesn’t load the full channel I’m in, doesn’t let me type, and even more annoyingly the most recent change where it doesn’t send my message when I press Return on my iPad’s keyboard.

It sent my message after pressing Return for well over a year before now,  but now it’s requiring me to manually press the send button even while exclusively on the keyboard. It’s becoming incredibly frustrating, and because of how recent these issues have shown up, I can only assume they were unintentionally added in the last update or two.

I hope I’ll get a response, given just how positive my interactions with the Discord team have always been, and I hope the issues will be resolved quickly, but it’s immensely frustrating that this is such a new issue."
"Today has been the worse day to be fairC hearing that NSFW channels will be removed and will not given access to those who are in IOS devices, I’ve read the article already about how IOS does not support any inappropriate or pornographic material/apps on the store, but we still have hook up apps where you can literally check out for a one night stand, or even other apps which “keep the privacy of one secure and deletes any archives for their safety” like Telegram that is fulfilled with illegal stuff. 
¿But they want to ban NSFW from Discord even if they have a bot set up for it that sends NSFW images at request? This does not make any sense at all, the app has been out for a long time now and this happening will reduce a lot of people to just delete Discord as some servers do not mainly based in the NSFW context but still have their channels dedicated to it. ¿All of that farming and effort gone? Friends, one sharing stuff and having fun with friends. All over because of IOS thinking that discord is “used primarily for pornographic content.”"
"There is absolutely NO privacy! Discord does anything to obtain your personal identification! I can’t even stay on an account without a phone number added for a few days. If you don’t input your phone number , they disable your account. If your email isn’t verified, they disable your account. This is just not okay. I hate how people feel as if putting their phone number into applications is a normal thing now. It really scares me ! We can’t even have our own opinions on this app , for there are horrid moderators of this app. I would absolutely love not having to put in my phone number to use an account. Our IP’s are secure, you say ? Your moderators have access to them , though? Police and others could track us down ?? How is this “secure” ? At least add End To End Encryption, my gosh.  By the way, can your moderators stop being so immature ? They ban you unreasonably. Even asking why doesn’t help, because your company has “investigated” already and still refuses to show ANY proof of ANYTHING . I think I may just quit this app, I just want everyone to be cautious of how vulnerable youre personal information is by using this app.  It’s funny how discord knows exactly who I am, please don’t call feds 😢😢😂😂"
"I use this app to call people primarily, but it’s been having huge problems lately. Often times when I exit the app, it kicks me out of the call that i’m in. It’s really frustrating because I want to use my phone while in the call, but whenever i press the home button it ends the call. Not only that, but during video calls, the app freezes up a lot of the time, to the point where i have to keep refreshing the app in order to get it to work. When I’m in a voice call and i’m talking to someone, sometimes it will just disconnect me for no reason, and I won’t realize for a minute or two because it only reconnects me when I lift the phone from my ear. 

Lastly, sometimes when i’m scrolling through a server or dm, it won’t let me scroll, and will only let me swipe to the left or right. I also can’t type in the message bar, and I can’t click anything on the screen. I have to restart the app in order to get it to work again.

Overall, the voice and video in this app is not great and the app itself is just really glitchy and laggy."
"Discord works really well, and I don’t have many issues with it. The updates are interesting and keep things lively. Although sometimes things can be cluttered, issues are scarce.

That being said, glitches are more common if your phone or PC is an older generation. The phone I currently use is an I phone 8. Discord runs very well on it and I’ll only have a glitch about once a month or every other month. The glitches don’t affect the performance of the app, it just hides my battery percent, time, and cell service at the top of my phone. I am starting to think it is a system issue.

Overall, discord is an amazing app. My club uses it that we run at my high school. I have made so many friends and it is great for community based involvement. However, there are also a lot of pedos and groomers on the app too. If you are a minor and get the app, I suggest looking for other minors to talk with. Be smart, and don’t do anything sketchy."
"Discord. I thought I was being hacked until I figured out you took my account. I was in a RP server call until a couple minutes later I get 
“Somethings going on here” 
I read the whole thing. And I can’t verify my account because it’s a fake Email because my old account is using my real Email which I’ve deleted many times to use my REAL email. But before I deleted that old account, I’ve tried many times to switch my Email to my 2nd Email. And it always says “password is in correct” even though it’s the right Email. And when I sign in in my phone and do the number option. It keep telling me something about “rating” and I can’t go through. I’ve tried everything. Nothings work. Not even you stupid “discord support” I want my account back. Nothing is going on. I’ve gotten no sleep and missed work and school to try and get my account back. This should of been a 0 star because if that. 
Until now it’s staying 1 star because of that. I want my account back. Because now I’m a inactive member in some of my RP servers. This happens at 4/21 , 11-11:45pm and I’m writing this @ 11:31am. I need my account back. I would love to rate you guys a 5 star but because of this it’s not!"
"To me, Discord is the best way to chat with friends, family, and strangers alike. It has an amazing and simple UI, and it works well on all my devices. The moderation side of things is well-thought out too. I own a server with my friends to talk on while gaming, and it is easy to add new roles for people. The bots in discord are good as well, because you can use them to play music, look things up, and more. Also, discord is a good way to chat with strangers and meet new people, without giving out your phone number. And as a final touch, discord’s sense of humor is great. It feels like there are no Easter eggs or humor in any software/apps these days, but discord is different: it has a friendly interface, with many features implemented that are funny. Overall, discord is an amazing chat platform. 

One more thing though: I’ve noticed I can’t paste anything into discord on mobile... it could be my phone though, since the storage is always full."
"I have been a user of Discord for over a year and a half, with my experience being extremely positive. However, recently the user interface has been changed and I’ve received many complaints about it being too childish and distracting. On several occasions I have been accidentally voice called because of the UI update. I’ve also had a myriad of people say that is too cluttered and they preferred the older layout. My moderators struggle with all the extra bells and whistles strapped to the mobile version of this application. I am here today with a proposal for two different modes; one is for people who want to play with the revisions and the other is for those who don’t want to be constantly assaulted with a waterfall of bloat they don’t use. I know that I’m a single voice but I’m here to speak for everyone who’s told me their issues with the new UI. I just want my server members and friends to be happy and it makes it hard on them if they can’t even tell where the pinned comments are. 

With deepest sincerity, Elite Lunala."
"This problem has persisted for years and no update has ever addressed it. I actually tried to go report this as a bug properly, but even that processes is so convoluted I said nevermind... Imagine a read only channel, where a mod posts an announcement that is too long to fit on screen at once. As you try to scroll up to read the channel, every time someone reacts to the message at the bottom, the chat jumps randomly all over the place. You simply have no control at all and cannot read anything because it jumps multiple times a second. Imagine in a server with hundreds of members how impossible this makes reading the post or channel (which is read only!) It doesn't just pull the viewer to the bottom of the chat where the reacts are either, it will repeatedly throw me back several pages and as I try to scroll to the message and it just keeps pushing me all over, wether my finger is placed down on the screen or not.

This is beyond embarrassing for discord at this point - if your basic features like reacts and scrolling cause bugs that make reading chat channels impossible, you have failed in your attempt at a chat app."
"I love discord and it’s a great hub for socializing and finding new friends, especially people to play games with. BUT this recent update where private calls showing up on the lock screen while okay, also shows up in my phones recent call log which is not okay. I’m a private person with an extremely busybody mom that I still love with and who still enjoys spying on things that she has no business sticking her nose in at my age. Discord’s private calls was a nice way to speak to my friends without getting the third degree but now I have to go into my call logs and make sure all discord calls are deleted now which is not something I had to previous do. 

On top of that, discord calls seem to be getting poor in connection to the point I’ve been considering finding a new app to use for voice calls, especially when competitive gaming of which I do frequently in Dead By Daylight. 

Discord, please stop making yourselves look pretty and fix these issues that never used to be issues. I want private calls 100% to stay in discord app, if I wanted to make a phone call I wouldn’t be using you."
"I’ve been having an issue regarding the subscription for nitro. I’ve tried 2-3 times , subscribing for original nitro , but it does not however give me the perks it’s supposed too. After paying nothing had changed and I haven’t received the perks , not even a notification to show that I had got it. I tried different payment methods and even tried different devices , paying with my apple funds on my mobile device , and paying with a visa card via pc. Even when it came to using a computer discord always crashed when I put my card info. I wasted 20-30 dollars with no refund trying to buy it. However it does say i have a subscription but through the actual app it doesn’t say I own nitro. I am thoroughly disappointed and upset with this , and hope to get it fixed. Gifting nitro seems to work just fine , but why can’t I get it myself? Note , I have tried updating the app , reinstalling , waiting a few days , and nothing changed. Please help!"
"On discord, a lot of potential stress about interacting with people is taken away since it’s mostly through text. (But there is also a verbal chat option if you prefer talking) If spending time with people in person wears you out or is stressful to you, discord is a great way to make friends at your own pace.

Edit: Since the new update, there have been in app notifications that block other things and can’t be turned off. In order to stop them, you have to mute everything which would also get rid of notifications out of the app which I do not want to turn off. These really takes away from the experience. I’ve seen developer responses on other reviews saying they are working on a way to disable the in app notifications and this will be in the next update. I really hope that update comes soon. Until then, I’m lowering my rating of a 5 out of 5 stars to a 4 out of 5 stars.

Edit: They have since fixed the problem."
"I’m not a review type person but i don’t mind to tell-it-like-it-is. I was trying to gift the boost to the server channel which I participate called Waters Above (.:WA:.). Actually the person who created the channel just boosted the channel 2 days ago so it’s not like there was any teachings on how to do it. Following the protocol what’s available through the discord I purchased at $9.99 and then there was a Q to share. I didn’t want to share on the options the Q offered; which were different channels of the server. I wanted my share the gift/boost on the welcome page. Well I thought I found where .;WA:. welcome channel. The  boost didn’t get where I expected. When it showed up on the welcome page somebody claimed it. A friend of mine asked “did I get it for her”;  I of-course said yes. Not really knowing what was going on. And it was hellish when she said it was already claimed. What the what???Are there any real people who work here,  they can help solve this problem please?"
"I met my entire friend group and even my current boyfriend through this app, I have gotten emotional help, and met people with the same problems with me and no longer feel alone with them (I have a pretty rare disorder) 
Needless to say I think this app is one of the best out there to be able to connect to other people through easy to use servers, text etc.  of course I cant promise anything but from someone who was able to find friends after 3 years of being alone, come out and feel safe safe about it (Lgbt) I think some others can find it just as helpful. 
From a person who sprawls in small groups, there really is anything for anyone on discord and its easy to find as long as you know where you're looking. 

Although with my obvious Bias I really do appreciate Discord, if you can stand some changing things about it as discord figures out to make it better, then its worth a shot to download and try out."
"Discord is all about friends and family but there’s is one thing. Toxic people who are minors, and mostly some minors plays games all the time like no big deal. If there is a updated that I would cancel swearing they should. There is some nice people, but to be honest, I feel like discord should have a respect because when I meet friends there friends who played Minecraft and other games sometimes, they are just doing inappropriate content and stuff. I purposely want to get rid of having discord and maybe talk to one another. I have like real friends and my best friend just uses his time just for no reason just to play games all the time. I purposely want him to just relax. And this time he swears and just play games like he is raging. But I do trust him and still love him as my best friend. But I want him to get over discord for a day. Please have some feedbacks about discord maybe talk to everyone to respect and no swearing to other people that like you know not joking around because one day that will be the last ending if you take it too seriously about jokes."
"Ive been using Discord for awhile, and it is my favorite app to use with friends. It is very convenient and quick to be familiar with. I dont have a lot major problems with it, aside from really aggravating lag and messaging interferences

The lag is hard to handle and annoys me more than I like. Having to tap to go somewhere refuses to work, often taking 20 seconds to actually go somewhere. This is really annoying when I am trying to view another server, yet the lag makes it look like I am frozen. The lag extends to messaging as well, in which the “send” button refuses to light up and let me tap. And when typing out long messages, the interface takes a vexing long time to extend. This means I cant see what I am typing and I end up having to wait, often at the cost of falling behind a conversation.

Please fix this! Discord works well for the most part, but the length it takes to message and perform basic functions does not sit well with me. Thanks."
"I think this to be a pretty cool application considering it’s a free to use messaging and calling service, which also lets you create your own servers for your own gaming communities/other things that may need discussion. One of the more recent updates, however, made it so when someone called you through the app, it would act as a phone call on your phone. This is an issue with maybe privacy, but also while you’re using the app. Since calls are so spammable in DMs or Group DMs, the call screen will appear on your phone and disappear rapidly. While on the calling screen, you cannot do anything other than accept or decline the call. This is an issue because that basically makes it so if someone spam calls you, you can’t do anything until they stop. If you go to block them, it will take much too long. Other than this issue, the developers are pretty good about fixing bugs within the app. Also, if I’m listening to music when I join a call and then leave, my music will have messed up audio after."
"Okay, discord is amazing not too glitchy and talking is super clear! But.. I was 11 when I got this app and my mom had restrictions for me at the time and the music and the talk on this app is not okay! Now they changed the aging on this app to 17+ which is better when I got it. It was 12+ had super adult talk in it… I am now 12…. I won’t be downloading this app again until I’m older… and I’m not giving hate to the app I think it’s cool I just think if there gonna change it to 12+ they need to limit the bad talk… I get why they put the bad talk in it because some parents don’t mind there 12 year old child listening to this bad talk… and I’m not saying that’s wrong. Every parent teach there kid/ teen how they want. Like spoiling them to letting them do whatever they want now.. I’m aloud to do a lot but I’m responsible and a lot of teens and kids are… I just think if they are gonna change the aging to 12+ just limit the bad talk please"
"Discord is a neat app to talk on. It has dark and light mode ((which I like)). And quite a few features. One bug that I found is in the “search center”. I’ll be trying to find something I posted a while back but discord only lets me go about 45 pages into my chat history. After searching about 45 pages it shows a “We dropped the magnifying glass. Can you try searching again?” page. I can’t zoom through the pages or else it will show up again. I can’t stay too long on it either, so it’s really hard to get back into my chat history. I think it’s a fun little page to see but when it shows up every minute ((And doesn’t go away until I restart discord about five times)) it’s not as interesting. I’ve noticed a few other bugs but I haven’t checked on them again since the most recent update. Other than a few glitches/bugs (( it could just be my device)) Discord is a really fun way to talk to people and other gamers!"
"Hey, so. I started to use this app so i could communicate with others, especially yters who have discord servers. As a mistake, I misspelled my email by one letter, so i went to change it because I needed to verify it to be able to message in some servers ,and since the email is incorrect, it wouldn’t send the message to my gmail/mail for verification. As I went to correct my email and hit save, it would give me a message. The message simply said something along the lines of, “email has already been registered.” I’m not sure what it meant by this, because i never verified my actual email just yet. Thus, once i hit save it wouldn’t change it. I’m currently stuck with an incorrect email that can’t be verified nor changed to the right one, because it’s misspelled so it wont send. Is there anything I can do to be able to change my email?? Oh, And i’m on mobile too... if that has something to do with it. What exactly does the message “Email already been registered” mean. My email hasn’t been able to be added yet!! And I haven’t given anyone access to it either."
"I don’t normally give 5 star reviews for anything but I love discord and it deserves it. Everything about it is so much better than the other big tech apps. For example, I no longer have my pictures available on Instagram or Twitter. In fact, I really hope bad things happen to mark zuckerberg. You know how when you want to share something on those apps, you have to go through your settings and enable certain pictures and then go back to the app? Well on discord, it allows you to do it directly from the app itself (so you don’t have to go all the way to settings to do it). THIS is what makes discord better. They care about you and your privacy and they have the right priorities. At least for now. This review is subject to change as more white capitalists are coming to discord and it’s getting better. But as of right now in July 2021, I like discord."
I started using discord around June of 2020 and I must say that it’s definitely done good to my life. I’ve met so many amazing friends from servers and just through mutual friendships that had already existed. It helped me get through a lot of quarantine knowing that I had people to talk to and had a  reason to get up everyday. I could share and discuss different sorts of interests I had like gaming and anime. I could even create my own custom servers where I could toggle around the settings and fixture it to my own liking. There are just so many endless possibilities and opportunities on discord that I don’t think I could get anywhere else so easily and helpfully. I 100% recommend getting discord if you wanna socialize with people just like you or wanna call up some buds to game with. Discord is definitely the app that I think highlighted majority of the year and I hope it does for the most part too in everyone else’s shoes.
"Works just as well as the PC version, easy to navigate and manage my servers

EDIT: I've changed my rating because I've been running into a problem again that I assumed was handled in the later updates from the early versions of discord. The app will attempt to upload images and then completely crash and close out, even with images that I've sent through it before. The only thing that will fix this issue is deleting and re-installing the app, which can be a timesuck, but this issue always comes back. I've deleted the app 3 separate times prior to this trying to fix the issue and it's a temporary fix. I use an iPhone 6, so it's possible it's some user-end issues, but please look into this and see if there's something you can do or if I can see what's messing with it on my end. The app is otherwise excellent, this is the main bug I've been having."
"Discord can be used for many things, Chatting with friends, DM friends, group chats, ETC. I use Discord daily because it where my friends and fans (I’m a youtuber) chat with me, the idea of letting you make roles and emojis is brilliant and a original idea. You can also use it just like messaging but without giving your phone # away. Although it does need fixes.
I use IOS and one problem that I have just recently encountered is that my discord broke, I would log onto the app and it would freeze and bring me back to the home page. I deleted the app then downloaded it again hoping it would work, unfortunately it didn’t. The next day I go on my settings to see if there were any bugs and apparently discord isn’t a app on my phone anymore, what? I am confused. Besides that it does glitch out every now and then showing old messages and then after you send a message it loads the new ones first. 
Besides that discord is a great app and fun for “all ages” I would encourage you to download it."
"I loooove discord so much I’ve had it for more than a year now and it’s amazing it’s better then any other app literally. I use it to video chat my family, text my friends from school, call people from around the WORLD to play games. Discord just makes me want to play games even more. The interaction I can get in one single app is amazing and all the emotes having ways to express yourself! The discord nitro with amazing moving emotes even better! And it’s amazingly cheap. Discord’s logo makes it look fun and wumpus plush is just so cute I love wumpus ^.^ also you can make YOUR OWN EMOTE!!!! You can have channels dedicated to other games for people around the world to interact in. It’s simple and easy to use. Whats even better is pining your favorite pictures or links! It’s helpful to find once so far up the chat. I appreciate discord so much for giving me such an amazing app to interact in. No other app can compete best of all its all FREE! ( except nitro ) but it’s cheap as fuuuudge. Everything else is free lol"
"Ever since the most recent update to mobile discord, which adds the entire, pressing the maginfying glass icon to quickly look through servers or dms or even text channels now showing the @ mentions you get and not letting you, when you basically go and click into another channel or another channel in a different server, not allowing you to quickly move back to that without searching or scrolling, it really removes the functionability of the app. Plus I really don’t want to see the @ mentions in the same area like how they are, the old way it was had been more functionable and easy to navigate, and plus with the addittion of the Live Stages, there should be an option to disable that from showing up, because those are really something that have no purpose or me and are just some random extra I will never use.

Or just, any way to revert it back to how it used to be before this most recent update, please. It’s annoying, cluttered, and just a mess and a hassle to deal with."
"I tried to set up Discord.  After getting the app and installing I tried to use it.  Two things failed; 1) I got an e-mail for verification.  When I verified it I was presented with a button to click marked “Continue to Discord.”  When I check on it the button responded visually but nothing else happened. 2) When I tried to launch the app on my phone I was greeted by a screen claiming “Something going on here,” and asked me to verify by phone.  I selected the country and entered my phone number and then received an “invalid number” response.

I then went to the support section and filled out a report about this after reading the requirements; no “burner” number, no landline, no prepaid numbers.  My number is a regular subscriber cell number.  After sending that in I got an automated response telling me the same info I had already read and responded to in my initial support request.  I was required to now respond to this bot response to get actual support.  I did so.  It has now been more than 48 hours since I sent that request and I have heard not a peep.

I have deleted the app from my phone and will never download it again."
Right so I’m giving this five stars so folks can see it and hopefully the developers do as well. Discord is great. Love the app. Love using the service. But the new thing they’re implementing. The complete barring of iOS users from NSFW servers? It’s absolutely ridiculous. I don’t understand why users who own their tech can’t do what they want on it. Maybe it’s corporate Puritanism. Maybe it’s Discord implementing a CyA measure. I’m not really sure. But one thing is for sure; it’s absolutely ridiculous that this is happening. If someone can get back to me on this I’d much appreciate it. Be it Apple or Discord. And to my fellow users. I call on you to come to arms over this. Those of us who are 18+ should not be barred from the content we want to see on the apps we installed on technology we have bought. Same thing with right to repair but that’s another battle for another day. Right now this is the battle we should be fighting.
"Ive been on discord for around 3 years and it is SO fun, i have met so many new friends on there. I absolutely adore it, but there is some problems. It’s not really fun how you can’t use animated emotes or even put gifs as ur profile picture and I get that it’s basically the whole point of the Nitro but that’s another problem I have.. The nitro is 𝙡𝙊𝙊$! That’s a lot for such little things. And a lot of people can’t afford that, so I would lower the price to maybe 50$ or around that area. Also I know there is some way to change it but I have no idea how so this isn’t much of a complaint but I just hate it when I put :) and it goes to 🙂 or :( to 😦just..no sorry-. And my last complaint is videos and pictures.. I can only send 1 second Vids bc it has to be under 8 something I don’t remember but it’s like a limit. I don’t really know how to describe it but it’s kinda annoying. Other than that I love it. 🤍🤍"
"So, the app overall is really good! And I definitely recommend it as long as you associate with the right people. Most people on discord are rude, mean and just terrible. But there’s a mix of just about everyone on discord and that comes in handy when you’re looking for friends. But, the notifications don’t work for me. And it’s not just me! It’s also my friends on there too, either it be direct messages or even server messages. I’ve went to settings and enabled the notifications many times but no matter what I do they just don’t work. So in the next update I’m hoping to see an improvement on that if it’s possible for, also I’d also like a way to delete the chat and have it deleted for good! Usually when you close a dm the messages stay there, but I’m also hoping for a way to delete it for good. I bet many people are looking for the same things in discord as I am, so please reply to let me know what could and can’t be done?"
"Life has taught me that you can’t control someone’s loyalty. No matter how good you are to them, it doesn’t mean that they will treat you the same way. I have been married to my wife for years with no idea she was cheating. Suddenly i started noticing changes in behavior, i suspected something was wrong. So i confided in a friend who convinced and introduced me to an hacker. He was able to hack into my wife mobile phone to access her Text messages, Call logs, IG, browser history, deleted messages, Emails and WhatsApp remotely . It seemed as though my life was spinning out of control getting to find out she has someone else. I filed for a divorce just could not continue with her lies. If you feel you have been exploited in your marriage and you need proof. I suggest you contact Jack on his email and thank me later, he is into any hacking related issues and can solve all hacking problem ‘Accuratehacker007@gmailcom’"
"Been using for almost 3 years and never rlly had an issue. Although it took me a few weeks to understand how to use discord bcus of how complicated it is to use. Its pretty fun, but I do wish they had a feature where you can browse to join a server on the app. It’d be so much easier to find things I enjoy. My main issue about why I didn’t give a five star is bcus I realized that whenever I watch a video sent into     a server, it lags and pauses by itself, it does it over, and over again. It kept doing it so I went to look and see if it needed an update. It did. So I updated it and it was still doing the same thing. Also when I play a video it says it’s playing, but its not and I have to reload the video multiple times. They seem to do nothing about that since that bug has happened to me for many months. I’ve checked my wifi and data but it all works perfectly fine. I hope the workers of discord can fix this problem as it really bugs me."
"With the constant upselling of Nitro and a dedicated Nitro gifting button, you think that they would have enough budget to buy an iPad Pro and actually test their app with a hardware keyboard and split/slide over views. The state of this app on iPad Pro 11” is nothing short of an embarrassment for Discord. The UI constantly breaks and slides messages or the text input off screen, you have to scroll up and long press on the closest message in a channel to for the app to redraw correctly in slide over. The image/emoji/gif picker is all over the place on whether it draws above the keyboard or stays within the app dimensions, depending on what you tap/click. The spelling suggestions window when using a hardware keyboard, regularly covers up the text input area in slide over/split, and the software keyboard does the same. Worst of all, the return key on a physical keyboard will start a new line instead of sending a message, with no apparent way to change it. The return key issue is new for me, but the other issues have existed for the past few years without any apparent fix. I’m considering cancelling my Nitro subscription because the experience is so bad."
"Holy crap i don’t know if it’s just for me or something but for the past few MONTHS it has been doing this weird thing. When i’m in a call on a server and i leave the app to just play games or just to do homework or something, the app would just randomly stop and reset or something making have to open my phone, reopen the app again and join the call. It’s always randomized for me and i’m never prepared for it because sometimes it would be 2 mins after i join the call and just get off discord (it still running) or it be a few hours and out of no where i’m out of the call. It’s so inconvenient for me and such a hassle. I cant tell if it’s a bug or a glitch or just something totally random for me but it’s infuriating. If this didn’t happen, i would totally give this app like 5 stars it’s super convenient and nice, simple, and easy to use with live-streams etc. it’s just the calls that aggravate me the most. Discord on a pc or laptop is the same thing but it doesn’t have this call dropping situation."
"Before the new update Discord was fun and easy to to use. Now however with the new update the relaxing, welcoming tone of the app and artwork changed into something more like Google and the other generic companies out there. Basically oversimplified compared to Discord’s unique style. I don’t mind the logo (besides the blue palate) but that and the call quality still needs work since it can be very glitchy/not work at times which I know does depend on the persons connection but still would be helpful. Lastly this could just be me but I tried changing my profile picture and for some reason no matter what I do it’s so pixelated?? That one is minor but other than that I like the app but I don’t love it like it’s good for calls, friends, gaming, and art but sometimes can be a bit frustrating to use. Just please don’t drastically change the app because that would just take away what it was made for and lose people who’ve been on Discord for years. It would lose the nostalgia and comfort that it gives to others."
"Discord has the potential to be a wonderful and inclusive networking tool for everyone, but unfortunately they have been ignoring a large part of their potential user base by not implementing basic accessibility measures. They are neglecting basic application decency that their competitors have already stepped up with. Discord has been saying for many years that they care about screen reader accessibility, for example, but they have done next to nothing to make sure that blind people using these softwares are able to effectively join their conmunities like anyone else would. I'm sure it's a great program, so I hear from my friends using it, but until they catch up with the times and make it so I can navigate with VoiceOver at least, only two stars here.

Regarding your response:
I don't think your team understands that you're asking us to submit feedback for an unusable system on that very system. Many people can't access that server, and the few blind folks who told me they could said it was by luck or coincidence.
You're telling us we can have a key to the house, but it's currently locked inside."
"The discord app had worked almost seamlessly in the past in the two years that I had used it, but with the new updates (the ones that coincided with the ""new fresh look"" of the message bar), the keyboard has been having very suboptimal performance, to the point where it interferes with my ability to use it so much that I decided to write a review to make this problem known. I've never had issues such as this one in other iOS apps. 

What happens is that I will sometimes type a message and it will jump to the middle of an already typed word and type in the middle of that. At other times, autocorrect will refuse to work, and when I type on messages to edit them, they will be fixed in the message bar but will send with the original typo. Sometimes, I have sent a message, and while it does send, the whole message will still remain in the message bar where I had typed it, making me clear it manually. 

Overall, my discord experience has been good across all platforms, but I do hope a fix for this is issued soon."
"Ok so dont get me wrong, I love discord I’ve been on this app for a while. The thing is, yesterday my group chat with my friends was gone, like it just disappeared. No one had even been awake and the owner of the group didnt delete the group chat because she knows that there are a lot of memories in the group chat. We had to create a new group chat and it was a little upsetting to us. Anyways, the next day we we’re talking in the new group chat while the owner of the group chat was offline. And she randomly started removing one of our friends, but the thing is, she wasn’t even on any device and she was sitting on the couch because she had a headache. I believe she is hacked or this is a huge glitch. I love discord though, I’ve made so many friends on this app. For those just scrolling through reviews, download it. This issue is probably just a mini bug and will be fixed in no time! :)vv"
"Don’t get me wrong, I love Discord and it really has a lot of nice people and people to talk to. But there is just 2 problems that make me uncomfortable with the app. There are a lot of Discord Predators out there and they are getting kids in danger or maybe kidnapping them. The next problem is the Toxic People on this app. I have a bunch of different friends on Discord, but there are a lot of mean people and hurting people on the inside. Some people don’t care about the ones who get bullied. But you don’t know what they feel, just like my friend left me because of a game. We was friends for 2 years and this happened about 4-5 days ago. So just don’t bully others on Discord please.

(P.S) some people won’t care about this review but it doesn’t matter. I focus on the ones who do care about the post and want to help with the Discord Community and what they are doing that wrong. 

Thanks for Viewing!"
"I was chatting with my friends and one of my friends told us that he leaked a bots IP… and THAT IP told us what that bot is and you know everything else, if you know what an IP is. And he warned us that the bot clicks on every link YOU or someone ELSE sends a link, message, GIF, or ANYTHING else. Seriously, that bot sees and clicks on everything. He or she is out there.. and I am SO SORRY I am freaking you out and scaring you. Seriously, I really don’t mean to. When my friend told me this, I got scared too. Just beware.. also why I am saying this is to warn Discord users out there and to let Discord know WHY THE HECK HIS IS HAPPENING?! WHY IS THERE A CREEPY BOT LITERALLY LOOKING AT OUR PERSONAL PRIVACY?! Discord, if you can PLEASE fix this immediately, that would be a HUGE help. I am very disturbed of how my friend told me this and how I know this thing exists. Sorry if I just ruined your day and scared you. I really didn’t mean to. I hope you have a good day and stay safe during COVID!! - A fellow Discord user"
"I've been using discord for a few years at this point, and I want to make it clear that I use this app every day. It's how I've met some of the best people in my life, friends across the world I would have never otherwise met and learned from. However, after the most recent update I can't help but have noticed the glitchy behavior of the app (on mobile). When I go to the emote button my whole keyboard stops working for a long amount of time I didn't usually experience, likely due to the influx of keyboard functions just recently implemented, and finally the discord connection servers in general have been acting super unusual. This might be a thing only I'm experiencing, I'm not sure. It feels as though discord has outages every week, and it's starting to get frustrating. I do enjoy the app and will continue to use it regardless of these opinions, it definitively can offer experiences with people that might change the way you see the world."
"I have Nitro supported Discord since the beginning. I love everything about it. Usually the updates are great and if they have problems they get resolved quickly. I was hoping this call display update would be improved somehow. The call acts like a real call on iOS and it’s really annoying. The status bar at the top of the home screen, the full screen display when the phone is locked, etc. When my phone is locked, I have to press the home button 3 times rather than once with finger print. First time wakes up the phone, second clears the call screen to my lock screen, third to get to the home screen. Second of all, every. single. call. shows up on the recent calls list. If you disconnect the call and start it again it shows up as a new call in the list. My recent calls is more discord than actual calls. 

This feature would cause me to uninstall any other app. An app needs to stay inside the app, not take over the rest of my phone. If other people like this feature, maybe make it an optional setting."
"Now I’m gonna give this 4 stars because I used discord for quite awhile and I love this app but the recently the API has been very glitchy and the new update didn’t help for me. My biggest complaint is that the phone calls now save to an actual phone log when you call someone....really? You had to add that. Just why? Now I’m uncomfortable using the app because I don’t know if the app is going to get inside my phone and monitor my information and monitor all of my contacts outside of discord so I had to uninstall and write this review :/
I also don’t feel comfortable if it gets saved to a phone log that the phone company can now see  who I’m calling on discord.(cause monitoring everyone these days is out of control). So I don’t feel comfortable using the call feature on discord because now my phone company has to see me calling a friend on discord. Everyone has a right to privacy and this app just doesn’t seem private at all anymore and just gives info out like candy"
"Since Discord Mobile has been updated several times, I’ve decided to return to this review and check out what has improved the most.
In my last review, I complained about the rediculously slow loading times. That has seemed to have been almost completely eliminated, which is probably the most positive change. And that’s really about all the good changes that have happened. Some minor complaints I have on the mobile port is the fact the app seems to not be as up-to-date to the PC version of the application. Most of the other complaints in my past review still remain unchanged. For example: All users are able to post whatever they want without the worry of a filter (unless a bot is set up in the server.) I’m still shocked by the fact that NSFW channels are able to be created on Discord when the app is rated 12+.

Most of the updates were mostly major bug-fixes. But at least the program is much more usable. All what I could really do is give the app another star for is efforts on keeping the app bug-free as possible."
"For some background I have to use discord for school clubs and homework groups. It’s ok in the regard that it allows you to text with large groups of people for free. 

But my big problem is that there is no privacy from discord. Your friends can see basically everything you do on your device, including exactly what game you’re playing and song you’re listening too. There is no easy way to turn this feature off, especially on the mobile version. As someone with social anxiety, I can safely say that this was an absolute dealbreaker for me. I’m a super private person and I believe that I should have privacy on my device. Just because I’m in a discord chat with someone doesn’t necessarily mean I’m their BFF, and even if it did I still wouldn’t be comfortable with sharing my every move on Discord. 

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE add a feature on mobile that allows you be completely private on discord. In fact, this is something that you should ask people if they’re ok with when they’re creating their accounts. I shouldn’t have to worry about facing social exclusion or bullying for my personal choices on my device!"
"This is NOT an app you want any child under 16 to have free access to...especially if you are not tech savvy.  Basically, you are allowing your child to chat with anyone.  I discovered some of the direct messages that were being sent to my son and they were completely toxic....memes about where to hide a knife at school, disturbing images, explicit content.  Oh, and some of the other  “friends” he was chatting with talked about how their parents just thought they were only communicating with other kids from school.  Do not fall for it parents!   There is one thing you can do (which I wish I had realized to do sooner) and that is only YOU, the parent, have the password.  Go into Privacy settings and set it so that no one can direct message your child, no friend requests etc.  If your child has the password, they will just change the settings back.  Make a condition of using it that your child doesn’t get the password.  Then they will have to ask you before adding anyone as a friend.  You will also be able to monitor everything they are doing which, sadly, you 100 percent need to do with this site."
"Hi! I know you won’t have much time to read this but I will really appreciate it if you do. First of all, this is a great app! There are so many things that I like. For example, you can make your own name and it will always be free to use! This is also a way to talk to all of your friends, make new friends and talk about your favorite things (gaming)! But to make this an even better app, I would personally recommend a few new features that I think everyone will enjoy! I think that there should be a feature that says when the person that you were talking to was last online. This can be used as a safety feature as well as a feature to see what’s going on because it can say if someone went missing when they were last seen or talked to. I would also recommend that you can tell when someone has read the message. And it’s for the same reasons as the other new feature. This is what I hope you can add to discord to make it a better app!"
"Have been happily using the app on iPad for years, but as of writing this review, it's been at least two weeks (and several app updates) since I've been able to press the Return key on my Magic Keyboard to send messages. Have to reach up and press send. Every. Single. Time. I don't think I have to tell you why that's unacceptable in a chat app.

I moderate several servers, including one tied to my workplace, and my iPad Pro is my primary device whenever I'm out of the house. As a result, this bug has been extremely frustrating, and despite submitting a support ticket and trying to reach out every way I can find, I've received no response of any kind. 

I almost never rate apps, unless I feel like I have something to say, positive or negative, and this time, what I have to say is this: Apps break, and that's okay, but don't ghost your users. Say something, anything, in response, even if it's just saying you're aware of it. Silence is just going to give people like me an excuse to start looking at alternatives instead of waiting."
"Discord is one of those once-in-a-while apps that come along and completely implant itself into your life without you even noticing it. Like TV or something. You kinda take it for granted, I think. Like you sorta forget that there’s a dedicated team of folks working tirelessly to provide it.

But this is actually a compliment to the folks who’ve worked to create this app. This app is so stable, high-quality, easy to work with, and so infused with gamer/nerd/etc love that it just becomes a part of your life. Just, “Oh I’m gonna hang out on Discord,” is a perfectly good way to spend a night. You wouldn’t say that for any other app. You wouldn’t even say that for Skype. Who even uses Skype anymore?

This is one of the few cases where I felt compelled to throw money at these folks. It’s so dang good. I can’t even begin to describe the appreciation I have for being able to stay in close contact on a regular basis with my gamer friends across the world."
"I’ve been using discord for roughly a year or so now so it only made sense for me to get the app. While the interface is high quality and the community unique, I hate to say it but it has a tiny little problem with constantly crashing my phone. Initially this only started when I tried to load certain photos or gifs. Sure that was annoying but it was tolerable and rare. And then it took a nosedive for the worse. Now when I open up discord and enter a certain chat my phone spontaneously crashes. Now the problem is when you crash you still are left onto the same chat. Thanks to that I am forced to not be able to use the app until I either get messaged of uninstall and reinstall. In false hope I tried to access said chat once again. To my dismay it lead to the same cycle. I desperately want to rate this app higher than three stars but until this issue is fixed it will stay that way."
"Hey discord people of earth. So discord has WiFi problems. So it’s June 24, 2019 and I have perfect WiFi.I was playing some roblox with my buddies and I decided we should call and roleplay in bloxburg. And it wasn’t only me. When we all went on discord the app loaded in but we couldn’t text or call. It was all white and black and we just saw white and black. We checked our WiFi and everything but nothing we tried didn’t work. We saw a new update on discord so we thought it was the update. When we did the update we tried going back on discord. But it still didn’t work. We all thought maybe it was the lag. But no. Everybody had a white and black screen. We all thought it was creepy so we thought we should write a review on discord about this. So please. If you have time to read this, you should do so. I’m not hating but it’s just that. Thank you for the people who read this. Friend me on discord!

"Discord is great, works well with call eligibility, texting, and server running. There are many options to choose in how you want to customize your own server, moderate somebody else’s, or having a role with certain powers. The discord system runs well and is greatly compatible with most devices. However, there is a major problem. I never receive any notifications, causing me to miss out on a lot of things. I turned all all notifications for discord in the setting on my phone, and didn’t get a single one. However I do it, uninstalling and reinstalling, restarting my phone, everything I do the notifications never work. This is a huge problem for me because I have a lot of things to attend to and text to my friends through discord, for meetups and events, but notifications are a major problem that needs to be fixed. Please fix this bug, but otherwise I am overall happy with this app."
"Overall it’s been a very good app. I love talking in vc with my friends and in one server, we’ve all really gotten into screen share “streaming” to one another. Now I only have an iPad and a phone, but I found out about two weeks ago that suddenly, screen share was allowed on my iPad and it worked surprisingly well. Sometime last week, I tried to screen share, but the app said some thing like “screen share coming soon to iPad”. I had used it just fine just a week prior to this. I updated the app and was able to easily stream again one more time last week. This week though, the app once again says “screen share coming soon to iPad” when it had worked fine. This time though, there’s not an update so that must not be the issue. My question is why is my iPad allowing me to screen share occasionally, but other times it claims that screen share was not available on iPad."
"I’ve been using discord for like a few months now, and I love the app! But theres something wrong I want to tell you guys, so while I was using discord I was like, “Okay, that’s enough for the day” then the next day, it says “Something’s Going on Here”. I tried verifying with my phone number but when I enter my discord password, it doesn’t work, what I mean is it does nothing when I press done. I tried pressing it several times but after a few failed attempts it says “You are being rate limited”. When I am entering the exact password for my account? This has been going on for a almost a month, and I can’t make a new account because it’s going to say “you have to delete the account” or something along the lines of that. Also, I’ve been researching on the Internet but it’s no use and I won’t attempt to go to your guy’s support page because a bunch of people say you guys don’t reply, don’t help, or don’t really care so I’m writing here because I need help going back to my account."
"The interface is clean, simple, and functional. but with the latest update, I have begun to dislike the direction it is going in.

The new text box is counter intuitive. It doesn't match the rectangular, in-line design format that the rest of the UI maintains. The gift icon has no reason to be right next to the image browser on mobile- why is it there? Buttons that are placed right next to each other should be related. I don't want to spend money on gifts NEARLY as often as I want to send a picture or an emoji in the chat.... it doesn't make sense. It makes it feel like a mobile game where there are ways to spend money around every corner. 

I beg of y'all not to start making everything round. EVERY other social app is round and soft and busy and all too friendly. Discord was just right- the simplicity of the design prioritized text-based conversations over anything else, which allowed for conversations to be easy to read, functional, and easy. Instagram and Twitter are dizzying apps with way too many features, and engagement/content is prioritized over conversation- that approach is far from what Discord's approach is, so it makes sense to me that y'all would avoid that visual language. 

pleeeease restore the prior, rectangular, text box interface. Finally, replies are convoluted. Replies feel clunky because they take up more vertical space... something to consider."
"As a mobile user, it is unfortunate that we cannot share our screens on the mobile app. On an iPad Pro, I would honestly expect someway to share our screens; for business, art, help, etc. Google meets and many other programs/apps allow you to share screens. Why is it that the computer, laptop, PC program of Discord allows a share screen tab and not the mobile? I understand that it may be difficult to add features like so, but this just seemed like common sense. 
As a mobile artist, I would like to share my work progress with my friends and others. I do not use computer programs therefore I cannot share my screen to show my artwork process. This would be a very convenient and nice feature to add and I assure you it would be used regularly by friends, artists, businesses, etc.
Thank you for your time and I do hope you consider my recommendation.

As a side note, Discord works incredibly well! Very functional and smooth."
People are making servers trying to force people into dangerous situations. I joined a server this morning and I got a alert from the server saying that I was required to give certain information to the provided link. Long story short the link tracks you and taps your device and lets certain people with access watch and listen to you potentially whenever they please. I do not recommend discord to anyone due to my attempts to make light of situations like this have been ignored. I ended up buying a new line of device’s because of the possibility of them watching my children. You need to crack down on this discord it’s wrong and gross. Ive seen it in multiple servers most are game related such as factions or based in a child’s game such as Pokémon. I was met with hostility and was removed by every owner or administrator of the 6 servers I joined just for not using the link. This is bad discord no person should be able to send links like that to anyone something needs to be put in place to prevent people from preying on others who are using the app.
"i’ve been using discord for years ever since i started role play, and before that, i used discord to contact my online friends. it made me overjoyed when discord started being used by role players. i honestly love it, it’s amazing. you can change it to dark or light mode (i recommend dark, the light is a bright white and it kind of gives you a headache). but this app and this website in general is amazing. there have been ups and downs but i honestly wouldn’t want to use anything like groupme, instagram, twitter, kik, amino, chatstep, or anything really over discord. yeah, it’s just great and it’s an amazing app and website. i HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend it if you’d like to communicate quickly with your friends and having funny little loading screens pop up that are sometimes so stupid that they’re funny, and it gives you a little laugh or a small smile and it feels welcoming i guess. but yeah, discord, you’re great, keep doing what you’re doing. you"
"So I know that this game is for kids and teens. Not much adults though right? I wish that “bad words” wouldn’t appear or something. I got this app because some friends on ROBLOX told me to! I go on it and call and play for about a week, and my dad comes in the room. I go on messages not knowing that this happened, but my friends were cussing each other out and I was super confused. I deleted the app but still play with some of those people. The one that actually cussed, I unfriended. But I play with the others still! I was just saying that if you want your child or you to not see “super bad words” then I suggest not getting this app. My overall experience was really good, no glitches, no ringtone problems, nothing like that. This game is for kids and teens and I don’t think either age range should really see like the “F” word. Don’t come at me saying things like “what are you 3 years old?” Or whatever because no I am actually in my teen years. So yeah! If you really read this far I hope you have a good day!"
"I’m going to cut right into the chase. Overall this is a very good app and i’ve been using it since January 2018. I use this app to contact my friends and have a nice time in vc’s and stuff, but i’ve just encountered something so irritating. When I was making emotes in my server, my nitro just suddenly disappeared. Also, i’m fully AWARE that my nitro ends somewhere around June 27th, June 28th, because I just bought another like a week ago. I feel like my money has been robbed because this is the second time this happened to me. It’s strange because I had nitro and I was using my emotes, but suddenly it just doesn’t work anymore. If you’re reading this, please solve this problem and regain my nitro back. My discord is Dark..#1590 I’m not sure whether this is a glitch or not, but I can’t fathom what’s happening right now. Please solve this case, or at least give me a refund."
"I wish Discord Mobile had the same options as PC, yes nitro users have more abilities because they pay more to support the Discord Company but I shouldn’t have to go out of my way to buy another device because my discord doesn’t have the same options as PC discord. Currently trying to figure out how to disable the auto emoji because on PC there’s apparently an option but my settings (on mobile) have no option for that. Anyways, I’m not just gonna complain in this review because that wouldn’t be true to the title nor how I feel, Discord is a great app and I love all of it’s features (except for auto emoji, some of us like to use non-spaced emoticons lol) my favorite features include statuses and the customization options for servers and bots!! Discord is so much fun and it keeps me occupied for hours (no I don’t go outside often, yes I should “touch grass”) with all of the server options and the friends I’ve made on the platform! Moral of the story, discord is good, maybe even great but it could be better! :3"
"The app is great when it’s connected to WiFi. It used to be able to run on cell phone networks but now it is constantly “connecting”. I have yet to find fixes online. I would rate it higher, but I feel that this issue should have been fixed already.
Update to developer response: I’m unable to switch cell networks and have tried different WiFi connections and they were successful.
Update 2: I still receive updates and messages while in cell networks, but the loading screen prohibits me from actually accessing anything.
Update 3: I’m raising my review because he customer support actually cares about the product. I will update the review further once my problem is fixed :)
Update 4: I’ve fixed the issue. The app works like its intended to. I appreciate the help with the developers and the care they have for their product. 5 stars. Recommended for its use and the response/feedback from the developers."
"This app is probably the worst I’ve used!!! It only has two useful features not found in other chat apps and those don’t charge a subscription fee to upload anything. You can’t upload anything over 8mb with paying a ridiculous subscription fee, can’t upload videos without paying the fee or using an outside video service and only posting the link, emojis are also locked behind the ridiculous paywall. In terms of good features it is only limited to two features not found and I can definitely do without those two minor things and prefer to use much better chat apps like line, fb messenger, wechat, band, and what’s app. Also those are free to use and don’t throttle what you can share without a ridiculous fee!! If I wasn’t forced to use the app for one thing I would have deleted this waste of phone space from the get go!! Ohhh added in ability to call extra people still crap maybe drop you fees to upload anything over the pathetic 8mb and allow use of emojis for free instead of nickel and dining people for every little thing you cheapskates"
"Hello. I have been on Discord for about 2 1/2 years now if not a little more. I have enjoyed the convenience it has provided when it comes to interacting with friend who don’t share the same devices as I do. However, most of the servers I am in the members have designated colors. One is Rose, I am Cyan, another is White, and so on and so forth if you catch my drift (aka Among Us colors) and we are wanting a more expanded response to message coloration. So if we respond with a heart I would like to use Cyan, Rose would use a light pink, and so on. There are some colors already offered. But we want a waaaaaay bigger color spectrum to be offered when it comes to certain emojis. The same thing with the tags or roles in the servers. More colors please. This would be much appreciated. That is really the only issue I believe I have with the app/program. Other than that I love it and it is very useful."
"I have had Discord for years and years. Not sure how many but probably around 5 years. I have loved Discord and making new friends, hanging out with people, and finding people who are interested in the same things I am. The sad thing is that recently more and more Sexual Predators have been reaching out to children on the app. Yes I do understand that children shouldn’t be on the app but it doesn’t make it okay. I’ve seen it happen several times and have even gone out of my way to get them in trouble. I had reported these account along with many children (7-11 years of age) and Discord did nothing. They asked for more and more and more proof. I gave evidence of them talking about their age and gave evidence of what the predators had done. They took 0 action to protect their members on Discord. Although it’s a great app you truly do have to watch and be careful who you are talking to. People don’t always have the best intentions."
"Discord, you need to fix the screenshare because I can't hear the audio when my boyfriend is screensharing a show or something. You guys also need to fix the weird ios call thing, where anyone can see im in a call if they pick up my phone. It was way more private before. It also sometimes turns off the screen if I try to turn off my phone screen because my phone is too hot! Please fix all of these things, because I'm getting very tired of the updates where they're ""supposed"" to be better, and they're really not. The best thing I'd say you
guys have done since these updates is give phone users the ability to get nitro, and that's about it. You guys need to stop messing with every little thing. That's all. For everything else, nice job I guess. Oh, and also bring back screensharing in server vc's, because for some reason you also took that away which was really stupid. Anyway, please fix."
"I use Discord often on my computer and sometimes on my phone and I absolutely love it! Discord is easy to use and the fact that they let you make your own servers completely free is pretty cool, especially when compared to a specific VoIP application.. (stares at TeamSpeak) Anyways, one you make a server, adding new channels, roles, and categories is a breeze! All you need to do is click a few buttons and type a little bit to setup your very own server! You can also add friends where you can use Direct Messages (DM) to just have a 2 person conversation with your friends, or start a Group DM instead of making a server that can hold up to 10 people. Voice channels/calls are a big part of Discord and need reliability, but unless you have bad internet, most of the time the voice servers are pretty reliable. Overall, I love Discord and will probably continue to use it for a long time."
"I started a thread with a suggestion. Someone asked we why I made the suggestion. Then everyone started labeling me a ‘complainer’ amongst other awful things. So, let me get this straight…They asked me why I was making the suggestion and I answered it, now I’m a complainer? All I wanted to do was make a suggestion and have a meaningful conversation about how to improve the game. There are a lot of hateful and spiteful subhumans in this app. If your looking for meaningful conversation about game improvements, this is not the place. Just send your suggestions directly to the company that makes the app. People are ignorant and disrespectful. Honestly, the interface is a complete train wreck. People have nothing relevant to offer. It’s very tribal and the moderators are just as bad. It’s just a steaming mess of hot garbage.

Stay away from Discord, it’s toxic and a waste of time. Just when you thought the human race couldn’t get any worse with Facebook and other social media…enter Discord. I just deleted my account, removed the app, bleached my phone and took a long shower to scrub off the remaining slime from using this app."
"I am a discord user, and I have to say I have never been more frustrated and surprised. For an app that everyone uses that works for everyone, I never thought I’d have this experience. I used to have an account, but I wanted to make a new one simply so I can use it for a certain website. So I decided to put in my information and make the account. I didn’t know at the time that I already had an account that had the same exact info. So it told me another account has this info and it can’t be used. So I decided to delete the account that already had the info. (Side-note:  Really? 14 days just to delete 1 account?! You guys are out of your minds!) Once I waited 14 freaking days, I decided to try and make the account again. Still didn’t work. So I was really confused on to why a DELETED account is still in their database?! I figured since they are still keeping the account alive, I might as well just use it. I tried to reset the password and it worked, but it still being me to the screen where it thinks something weird is going on! FIX YOURSELF DISCORD!!"
"Ok, so when I first had Discord there were no problems at all, the next few days they were ok. But when I use it a lot it would take a very long time to load and kick me out of the app. I deleted it and re downloaded it again and it worked. Only one time. So I’m guessing I’m gonna have to delete it and download it again every single time? I had this problem a few months ago and even when I updated it, it still doesn’t work. No matter how many times I refresh it, it’s still the same. It only works one time and done. No more last chances, I just got back on discord when I downloaded it again. I don’t know if I’m the only person experiencing this because I use Discord on my phone since my computer shows rip-off’s of Discord which was annoying. I’m still trying to figure out what’s happening yet nothing worked. I’m only asking for the loading screen to be fixed since I have to download it a bunch of times for me to get into the app."
"No h.265 or m4v video support, eats ram and reloads a lot in the background (and takes a good bit of battery life), gamer styling is pretty bad, no option to disable converting text to emojis within the app, can bug out when doing too many things at once, shows old and now nonexistent dm’s and channels on the share sheet, colored text (like yaml) only render as normal white text unlike on pc, no screen sharing, a GUI bug of the popup telling you that an image has been saved blanks out once you exit the image from full screen, the design is atrocious on iPad (the keyboard (when split), and the popup of pictures to upload covers the send button when discord is full screened, and also hides the entirety of whatever you’re writing if discord is in slideover mode), data collection is a bit excessive even with the settings set to minimize that as much as possible, etc. etc. Most of these are nitpicks, some of these are probably just technical limitations on mobile, but they add up and I don’t like using it."
"Don’t know when this started or how long it’s been happening for me but it seems like almost every other time I open Discord, the app crashes before it even logs me in now. I enjoy the app a lot and it is very useful as I have many cross platform friends that I communicate with and talk to on the mic with in the app, but this bug doesn’t even allow me to actually use my account half the time because Discord won’t even launch properly half the time. It’ll sit on the first screen when you open the app for like 15-20ish seconds and then close back to the home screen, and when I try again usually the same thing happens. Don’t know a good fix other than uninstalling and reinstalling but it doesn’t fix it for good, it continues to happen after about a day of the app being back on my phone. Would love to update my review if the developer can get back to me on this or fix the bug in an update."
"Great app, I’ve been using it for a long time now but in these resent updates there has been glitches with the calls and notifications. If I’m in a call with someone on Discord it will show up as two separate tabs on iPhone, and when I lock my phone it shows up as a call so I won’t be able to see the time or any other notifications and it’s a struggle to get it to close just so I can see the lock screen of my phone. And with the notifications, there’s not a problem for when u mute a server or chat, u won’t get a notification because that’s what it’s suppose to do, but even when u don’t mute or turn off notifications for a server or chat it won’t give you the notifications. And I know it’s not just me with this problem my friends and basically anyone I talk to on Discord has this problem. I hope this problem can be fixed in the future and I appreciate all the hard work that’s been put in this app."
"while i love using discord and i often use it as a means to contact some of my friends, i have noticed one issue that i’ve experienced. when i type “:) or <3” or other emoticons it automatically changes it to “🙂 and ❤️” or whatever emoticon i’ve put down. i’ve searched and searched and searched for ways to fix it on mobile, but i cannot seem to fix it. i have an iphone 11, and it won’t show me any possible way to prevent it from changing emoticons to emoji’s.
i personally detest emoji’s. i don’t like using them unless i’m using them ironically/as a joke or there is absolutely no emoticon that fits the conversation. i would MUCH rather have to manually put in emoji’s rather than have it constantly change my emoticons. the only time it doesn’t change is when it appears as part of a word. for example: “hi:)” rather than “hi :)” which i prefer the space in between. it really irks me. i hope y’all get this fixed !!"
"Discord is an amazing app! So it deserves this five star! But this part doesn’t really have to do with discord in general. This is about a server that I own. The admins and moderators in MY server are forcing me to be Co-Owner because I’m underage. I’m only a year away from being the exact age to be on discord! It’s been getting me in a sort of depression Because they are saying stuff about me such as. Stubborn, Lazy, Drama starter. So this server is a fan group of Spirit Halloween! More that 100 members and I just want this to end. I need to find a way to stop this. They act like THEY are the owner. So they are kicking people from the server for being underage. I asked is it THAT big of a problem? They care more about the server than the people having fun in there. So if I get a developer response in this I will be gladly appreciated that you understand about this chaos that is happening in MY server.

-Thank You

"Honestly I love discord.  I joined it a while back and use it almost every day.  I love the idea of bots too, I haven’t seen many other apps do something like that.  It has so many features and consistent updates.  Though it has (somewhat rare) issues like the entire app not working for a bit.  It can be very inconvenient depending on what you’re doing at the time.  Though this isn’t too bad as it’s often fixed very quickly, within a day at most.  It’s no worse than any other chatting app at the very least.  So it isn’t worth docking a star.  It’s not perfect, but no app is.  It’s next to perfect, and isn’t that the best something made by definitely 100% humans who aren’t actually robots gathering our info as they slowly find ways to put the human brain into a trance therefore mind controlling us so they can finally take over the world can get?"
"i love this app and its great to communicate with friends and others, pretty nice app, but i have several suggestions, first suggestion is to maybe replay or rewatch previous calls you had with others, it can be useful to find evidence of things that need proof or just remember memories. another suggestion is you should add a feature where you can change your discords background and the text color, you can also change your background to any image you prefer, and also have presets for the background and text, and also have animated backgrounds but that needs nitro and same with the image background. and maybe add a custom discord notification sound, you can put in a mp4 sound thats short enough like the normal sound or get a sound from the notification sound library, kinda the same like the choosing a preset color for your background and text. and allow custom nitro emojis for about me profiles, but need nitro for it. and my last suggestion is to make group chats up to 20 people, overall the app is good itself and perfect for making friends and deserves more attention. it would be amazing if you could add some of these suggestions as they would be very helpful for some users like me, many thanks if you do add these suggestions. sincerely mia"
"A really really good alternative to skype. I absolutely love Discord. I gave it a 5 star because it has been with me for the past year and I can safely say Discord, In a good way, has been the most influential app in my life. It is has become a key part of my day to day life and I’ll never ever delete it. However I do have two problems, it’s not to devalue the awesomeness that is discord but constructive criticism. Firstly I feel like people should sign in more often, maybe once a week, so that way someone can’t just pick up your phone and scroll through your messages. Another problem I have is just a minor bug fix, sometimes when I’m writing and then I delete everything it still looks like I’m writing something. Like three little dots are still under my icon even though I’m not typing anything. However it is a very good app and I recommend it."
"I think the app is great overall but it could use some more features that would better improve the app's overall quality.
First of all, it would be great to have a feature that introduces multi-member selection! I think this feature would be useful in servers when you need to ban or kick multiple people at once, or in the friends list when you wanna clear out those inactive people. 
In addition to that, I think file upload support for audio, zip or other file uploads that aren't videos or photos would be amazing! Just think of all the possibilities that could be imaginable, from sharing a texture pack with your friends or showing your server members that new song you've been developing on that music app you bought. 
But, Discord is still great overall even without these features because you can talk to friends from long distances."
"Discord is a great messaging service for anyone. Developers,    G a m e r s, and anything else you can think of, the possibilities do have an end but it’s a pretty high amount of possibilities 👌. Discord images deleted or not no matter what server is selected appear in your Discord cache though. Might want to clear it every once in a while. Discord has screen sharing, video calls and the ability to stream a single page or game in decent quality with good FPS depending on your computer. The amount of servers you can join at once is pretty endless, maybe I don’t know. This can allow to connect with a lot of communities at once and connect with others on your favorite subjects. Besides a few incidents with the Trust and safety team and the ToS. Besides that, Discord is a pretty spicy app.
                                                                       
                                                                             Yee"
"the app on mobile used to run amazing but now it just seems to crash and load slowly a lot. this has been going on for a few months and i am on the latest iphone version+discord version. after about an hour or 2 in a voice call it crashes, then when i reopen the app sometimes it says that i am logged in on another client still in the same voice channel due to how laggy it is (it’s not my account being hacked, i have 2fa, secure password, never have clicked any links that i don’t know). then i can leave the call and join again, however then i cant hear audio and it lags if the audio does show up. it takes a couple sessions of disconnecting and reconnecting to ACTUALLY let me join a vc and be able to hear voice. also, sometimes it can take up to 5-10 seconds to actually leave the call after pressing disconnect. everything works perfectly on the desktop version and i don’t have any of these glitches there so i don’t understand why the mobile version is so buggy."
"It’s a great app, what can I say. The devs are always working hard when the community finds a glitch or bug that would make it less appealing, there are servers for literally anything, and it’s simple to use. But I just have one problem. The new look. I think the dev team should greatly consider implementing an update where you could customize say the color of the new read messages and stuff like that. It’s a simple update, really, but there are probably many other people who would want some sort of appearance customizer. Other then that, it’s the best social app there is. Obviously I will not give it anything below a 5 for something as small as customizing the appearance, but it would be greatly appreciated if you considered implementing my idea. Thank you for this wonderful app!"
"I’ve been using Discord for a year now, and I’ve noticed some problems with both PC and mobile.
Currently, I use my computer for Discord and had no issues for a month. But I did run into a slight problem. I was playing a game until I accidently pressed on a key that activated something weird to happen. My Discord app kept popping up during the middle of me playing my game. I tried my best to solve it but it didn’t work. I tried searching up how I could resolve this, but nothing has worked. Speaking of that, re-downloading the Discord app was really troublesome for me. A message saying “Error” kept showing up. At this point, I was really frustrated and decided to restart my whole computer just because of that.
My problems on Discord for mobile was very little. But, doing things such as managing a server on mobile is also tiresome because of limited abilities we are granted.
I hope these problems get resolved quickly or as soon as possible."
"I always change my icon on mobile since I like to keep all my pfp images in one place on my iOS photos app, since I find it easier to navigate than Windows Explorer. However, since the last update, changing my icon on the mobile app has been made impossible, due to an issue where NO MATTER WHAT THE QUALITY OF THE PHOTO IS, it will end up blurry and pixelated when you save it as your Discord icon. This has been like this for DAYS, and the fact it has been almost a week or longer with no fix is absolutely abysmal. This should be a top priority issue, seeing as icons are the one thing every one will see when they open a server or channel and look at the active users in chat or at the user list. I’m in no place to judge when it comes to how much time it takes to fix a glitch like this, seeing as I’m not a programmer, but seriously? An icon bug pops up and you don’t make it the top item on your list to fix immediately? As a long time Discord user and fan, this is extremely frustrating and disappointing. Fix this bug. Please."
"Alright, I’ve been using this app for years. It’s improved in so many ways. While I fixed the following problem by reinstalling, this should not have been a problem in the first place: it kept crashing. To specify, I was on an announcements channel in a server and every single time I would open the app it would crash, kicking me off. Simple solution, but I’m surprised it can still happen even with all of this progress? Lastly, the UI update for DMs. I keep accidentally calling my friends and notifying them when I’m trying to go find something that was longer ago using the search function, realizing it isn’t there anymore. Can you at least add a notification that you are about to enter a call with someone before it puts you into the call, or revert it? Because that’s the other thing that’s been annoying me. Thank you for reading the review, if there is anywhere I should forward this to, please don’t hesitate to ask."
"I absolutely love Discord. It’s by the far the most used app on my phone. I practically live on Discord and I’m a bot dev. As I’m sure most IOS users know Discord has been having trouble with vc issues lately on IOS. Discord has been putting out updates to fix that which I think is great. However, ever since the latest vc patches, Discord on my IPhone has been unusually slow. I’m talking constantly freezing, crashing and just taking forever to load stuff and even send messages. When I open a large server is when things get real crazy. Sometimes I have to wait 2 min just to switch to a different server. Not sure if this is a problem with older phones since I a using an IPhone 5s which isn’t exactly the greatest. Anyways just wanted to point these things out. Fix these small kinks and I would definitely rate 5 stars (would be more than 5 if I could). Thanks for everything you do Discord staff and keep up the good work 😊"
"Okay. Straight to the point. Discord is great. I have been using Discord for years and absolutely love it. It lets me talk with my friends out of school, and lets me make new friends online. Great app if you want to keep contact but don't have their phone number.

Slight issue though. You see, I mostly use Discord on mobile, and I'm starting to have an issue with the status thing. I set something, then don't want it anymore. Yes I clear it, but then I closed the app to check for updates, none, so of course I went back to discord, but the status was still there, even though I removed it. I tried to remove it through my computer, but it did the same thing.

I was wondering if this could be just a Discord mechanic or a bug? I just want to make sure in case anyone else is experiencing this. And again, Discord is one of the best social apps I have ever downloaded onto my phone."
"hey i had discord for a long time and around 2019 i installed discord on my phone , it’s a really great app to contact friends the bots in servers can be a little glitchy same with the calls and vc calls , and everything else is ok, just the recent update is bothering me like the font and color of the app , and also how when i share my screen on my phone on discord it says “this app may not be supported” which is annoying, also nitro is a little pricey just to send other emojis in other servers and the send videos that are high quality, anywho In the recent update my pfp (profile photo) has been coming out pixelated no matter what i put even an high quality photo, only gif pfp works , i even unstalled and installed it to see if that works it did not, this happen on Friday and i don’t know how to fix it, i see that i’m not the only one, so may you please fix this glitch, I want to change my pfp already instead of having it a gif all the time."
I LOVE THIS APP OMG!!! ok so this is an amazing app because of how great the accessibility is. It’s super easy to talked to friends and join servers. personally i love making servers i find it very fun to either make a big server so all of your friends can chat and even have movie nights by using the share screen feature. I even made a server for my robotics team which was helpful for recording what we talked about etc. The real issue id like to talk about though is with the recent update for me and some of my friends when you have a new pfp it’s blurry :/ this is a major inconvenience because i love changing my pfp especially in the art community i love drawing my own pfp but when it’s blurry it’s just a big down side to this app so i hope it can be fixed! besides that i am in love with discord and would definitely recommend!
"Ive been using discord for around 3 or 4 years now, and ive loved it so far. However, its been getting very VERY slow, since the last update. I'm not sure if it's my phone, but nothing's happened to my phone before or after that except for occasionally dropping. The last time i dropped it though, was months before this, so it wouldn't make sense for it to do this. I make sure I'm on trusted sites, and i have a good amount of storage, i dont have many apps on my phone, most are system apps. 

This had made it EXTREMELY hard to call anyone, switch between channels, dms, or servers easily, or just do anything on discord. it feels like im having to wait for 3 minutes before i can send any message, and even longer before it lets me start typing or go to a different channel. and when i call someone, its even WORSE because it will keep disconnecting me, discord will crash and close itself, or its just so insanely slow that its just outright frustrating, and it makes me want to stop using discord all together."
"I love discord it has connected me with my friends since of 2018. It’s the best out there right now. Nothing can beat it. But there is one thing that pisses me off with this. The glitches. One glitch is when I put my iPhone on sleep mode or I leave the app to go to another app. The discord call stops. This can be really annoying as when your in a video game. Every second counts. In that frantic, 5 or 10 seconds of you unlocking your iPhone and reopening that app you could get sniped or get killed. It’s a really annoying bug and I hope this gets fixed but this is a really bad one. I am a Discord Nitro member and all I can tell you is that this is the best. I do not have issues on PC and Mac but I always have calls on my iPhone so if the awesome team at Discord could fix this glitch then this will officially be the best app for gaming ever. Like it is but the bugs are just really upsetting and annoying."
"I’ve used Discord for years now and I’ve loved it but lately I’ve noticed some glitches with the app. There is a glitch where you can be typing in one server and then next thing you know the same text will appear in your keyboard on a totally different server like you typed it out for that new second server when you never had the ability to type in that certain channel in the first place. The only way that you can fix this is you have to uninstall and reinstall the app. That has happened to me multiple times and it needs to be fixed. And now there is a glitch with the newest version where my Discord information at the top of the screen is clashing with my clock, battery percentage, and so on at the top of my phone. Also now there is a glitch where I can’t get notifications for messages when I’m not using the app. I have tried everything. I would appreciate it if this issue was fixed."
"I’m a gamer and many players use the discord app. A few months ago, I had issues logging in, actually I could not so I reloaded the app on my iPhone and it worked. It returned to its old habit within a few weeks by not allowing me to log in and so I deleted it. Our group has other apps, one old, and others suggested so I stayed away from discord. This morning I found a need to download it again because of another gamer....and yes, same issue. When I was unable to login, I went to my browser and changed my password just to ensure I wasn’t typing it incorrectly. When I returned to the mobile app...nothing. APPS SHOULD NOT BE THIS DIFFICULT TO GET INTO. I have googled the issue and there’s been MANY complaints of this. My problem is that most of the online resources posting possibly fixes are for PC/MAC’s......I think I’m done. I hate to leave negative reviews but it’s become so disappointing and frustrating that I felt I needed to warn others of this issue. I hope Discord fixes this in the future for others who may run into this problem."
"For the most part, Discord has been operating fine. As a primarily mobile user, I find that, for some time now, the app will freeze either after you type or edit a message—you may still type in the text box, but you cannot submit the message, nor will the app then register any other action taken and you are forced to close out of the app in order to continue.
Upon doing so and reopening the app, any text in the box will be gone, as if it were never there. If you were attempting to edit a message, the original message remains and anything in the text box still disappears. I’ve taken to copying most of my messages in order to paste them upon reopening the app, but it gets irritating when it needs to be done every single time.
Hopefully something can be done, but, until then, 3/5 because half of Discord is reading the information and the other half is typing it out."
"I’ve cut my cord with TeamSpeak LONG AGO because that’s not how one should host real-time voice chat.  All my friends were transitioning from Skype to Discord when they first heard about it, so I did too.  I cannot say I’ve regretted that choice.

Discord is basically one of those apps/services that might seem boring or difficult from a screenshot, but it is such a simple and helpful tool that I use DAILY.  How is it this good?  It combines some of the most powerful features in regular text and voice communication into a free and easy-to-use app that you can view in a web browser or download on your computer/phone.  The experience doesn’t change, regardless.

The app itself is a slimmed-down version of the original desktop version, which the servers & channels and playerlists being in their own hidden panes.  This doesn’t hold me back at all. The app runs fast and is actively being improved all the time, with new TestFlight builds releasing every few days.

I can only think of one downside that doesn’t really affect my overall love for this program: when will there be a console version of the app we can download?

To conclude, it’s the best thing since online multiplayer.  It beats having to call a ton of people just to talk to a few.  And most of all, it beats having to pay for server hosting!"
"I have been using discord for a while now, it’s been amazing! Whenever me and my best friends are playing among us we can secretly tell each other who killed each other so we can always know how to react. One thing I wish would be different is that when you unfriend someone, their messags and texts, along with yours, should dissapear. I had someone threat me to kill myself and so I unfriended them. This girl was my best friend, so I know she was raging with her life and she takes it out the other way, wrongly. But I unfriended her to give her some time that she needs, alone. Yet, her messages kept bothering her now. I hope if you unfriend someone that their messages go away. I hope this will happen in the furture as an update. I really hope that she’ll be okay. Other then me and my suicidal friend, this app is really amazing. I’m able to chat with anyone I want, and create servers within the media."
"Don’t get me wrong, this is an amazing app. I’ve met many new people, and it’s so fun to have it in quarantine and you can still socialize without going anywhere. We also relate a ton, being around the same age most of the time, servers are amazing for finding new friends and when you find the right server it’s such a great experience. The only problem I have with discord is the private calls. Such as calls in groups, or DM’s. When I start a call there it’s fine. But after about 5-10 minutes if I try to mute it has delay, and I press it again but because of the delay it just unmuted me. Even with push to talk this happens, and I don’t know if it’s discord or my phone. I assume it’s discord, because this problem doesn’t happen when I’m in a server’s voice chat. So please fix this, it’s really annoying to deal with but it’s my only real complaint."
"Discord is an amazingly useful and self sustaining app (by that I mean financially, I know you guys work hard to keep it working), it’s incredible that so much ease of communication and interaction can be stuffed into this one app. Streaming, calls, chatting, pretty much better than texting.

- Suggestions
Of course nothing is perfect, here are some suggestions.

1. I suggest favorite emotes so we can easily just put whatever we like at the top of the emotes list. Preferably we would hold down on the emote or right click on pc to favorite it.

2. Help list, I don’t know if one already exists but it would be nice to have a short list of all the things discord does on its own. Such as green text and blacking out text. 

3. Longer hypesquad quiz, right now it’s just a general personality test that doesn’t mean much, I think you should only be able to take the test 3 times and that it is much longer so as to perfectly narrow down the type of person each one is.

4. Haven’t seen it, but I’d appreciate a transparent chat overlay, one where only text shows unless you press ‘ + shift. Just something so the chat can be accessed more easily during gameplay without buying a whole ‘nother monitor.

Thank you for discord, don’t forget to read these reviews."
"Honestly it pisses me off, its been a really long time but they STILL never added the audit log settings on the phone, yet you can use it on PC. I also have so many times where I come to a problem, that when I go to server settings, the “Members” and same goes with “Roles” and most likely probably another option too, but when you press the button the majority of the time it just loads. Loads some more. Keeps loading, and loading and loading. But it just NEVER loads at all, just shows the loading GIF. This also mainly occurs when I’m using my data but still the same thing reoccurs even when connected to my home internet. Don’t get me wrong I love Discord on PC though. If I could I would rate 100 stars for the quality, ideas, community etc.. And they’re not at the least uptight or boring compared to every other out there. In my honest opinion of course, and I would surely doubt that anyone would think Discord is just bad or anything, but on the app we have issues though."
"Whatever changes they were trying to fix with the patches put out by 2.2.5 and 2.2.6 have caused my device to repeatedly drop connection to the server and have my voice sound roboty to my raid group. I have just pulled up the old 2.2.4 version from my time machine and am aboutto put it on my phone to test it out. But fortunately on a second device that I have out right next to me I already know that the recent version are the problem. Why? Because during the entire time of me writing this my older phone that is running 2.2.4 has yet to have its connection the server drop just like what was happening on my shiny brand new iphone X. I have been using my X has my raid mic since I got back in November and everyone has commented on how clear my voice sounds. The only thing that has changed and this is this app. I will update when I put the older version on to the X. 

Discord there is a problem and I would like that you revert whatever changes you were intending to fix because they just don't work for me and for several others that have written reviews on iTunes."
"This is a really good app. I use it everyday, mostly for gaming. It’s easy to communicate with my friends. But their are also problems for mobile users, or what my problems with it are. When I turn on do not disturb on my phone it stills gives me notifications. It gets really annoying because I can’t go one second without having to see a notification from discord. Even when it’s on DO NOT DISTURB. When I’m asleep I just hear the calling sound and it’s super annoying and loud. It even gives me notifications with mute on. Another problem is the server voice chat. When I’m in he voice chat on me phone it keeps flickering a black screen and I don’t know how to stop it. I press the home button and it turns normal but then goes back to a black screen. I don’t know what the cause of this is."
"Despite on how I enjoy the app from communicating with my friends and other people on discord. I have been seeing this message pop out in my screen out of nowhere and it said “something going on here, we’ve detected something out of the ordinary going on. To continue using Discord, we will need you to verify your account.” So then yes I tried reinstalling the app once and the message kept popping up, even when I was using my phone number that was linked to my gmail, I clicked done and nothing happened, I didn’t even receive a gmail notice on the app of discord. Even when I tried using another new gmail account all it did was “password does not match” even though it was rightful to me. Someone please fix this asap, I don’t know if my account was verified or not, but what I would like is a change for this to happen because this makes me feel disappointed on how this app treated me on my discord account"
Hey discord! I’ve been using your mobile and computer app for quite some time now.. my only suggestion at the moment would be to please (please please) remove the feature where if anything gets in front of your front facing camera the screen turns black. I understand this is for calling with the phone up to your ear but even with the sound changed to play out of my phones speaker I can’t even go under a blanket on a call without the screen going black. All of my friends seem to be having frustration with this same issue and the screen turning black on them constantly. It also makes it very uncomfortable and tedious for me to try to setup a video call with my back camera since I can’t cover my front camera without the screen turning off if I wanted the other person to not see my face.
"Hello, reader. I wanted to make aware before I list my complaint that, when working, Discord is amazing. It’s a great and fast app. However, I’ve been having problems recently. It started 2 days ago. No images would show up on my device. Not even on the website. I let it sit, figuring there would be an update to fix this. 2 days pass and nothing has changed. I decide to delete the app and redownload it. However, when I did, I was stuck on the loading screen. I waited 5 minutes and nothing. I read some of the other reviews and decided to delete the app and update my iPad. I then redownloaded discord once more. There have been no changes. I’m going to see if it eventually loads. If it does, I’ll edit this review. My device is and iPad mini 2, running iOS 12.4.1. Thank you for your time.

EDIT: Hey, thanks for the reply! Sadly, I couldn’t update my review soon enough. But anyways, my discord is now working very nicely! Thank you!"
"I haven’t had Discord for too long and I’m already having issues with screen sharing. 9/10 when I go to share my screen with someone who I’m in a call with (doesn’t matter the number) it will not work. I have updated my phone to the latest update and updated Discord to the latest update my phone will allow me. This is extremely frustrating and irritating because I wanna share my screen with my friends and play games with them to where they can see my screen. However, due to the glitch/bug, whatever you want to call it, I cannot do so. Due to this I have gotten frustrated on multiple occasions and so has my friends. This is extremely irritating due to it saying it is sharing and then not working. I’ve looked up different ways to fix this and none of them have worked and it seems that some people have had/are having a similar problem to mine. Please fix this ASAP."
"I've used discord for some years now, starting out with using it exclusively for gaming with my buddies and finding new people to play with, but later broadening my use to include social servers and such. It quickly became my most used app where I've made strong bonds with people from all over. Discord is a fantastic app with (mostly) fantastic people and a mind-boggling amount of servers based around any topic you could think of. This recent update, however, is a small thing that is pretty bothersome. The new 'reply' system where it makes the text smaller and you don't have to actually ping someone makes me so frustrated for some reason and it would be awesome to just press backspace on the update. Once again, it's a fantastic app that I've had almost no problems with over the span of around three years, but more recent updates are making it less and less familiar."
"The app works pretty good and I enjoy having it for my gaming squad but there’s honestly ONE thing that bugs and annoys me and that is most of the time I can’t even send a 10 SECOND video without it saying “Your files are too powerful” and it’s ridiculous because other people in my chat are sending in 34 seconds to a MINUTE long videos with ANY problem like it’s nothing, and they don’t even have the Nitro upgrade. The only solution to that problem is if I upgrade to Discord Nitro and it just doesn’t seem worth the money to send at least a ten second video. I think it’s crazy we have to pay to send in clips and videos and would strongly advise against that because there are plenty of other messaging apps that will allow me to send in longer clips than a minute without a problem. Other than that this app is great 👍🏻"
"I have loved discord ever since I got it 2 years ago. Texting people and finding friends is extremely easy, and making a server is no where near as difficult as I expected it to be! However, with the interface in the newest update, there are somethings that I’d like to change, or have an option to toggle. Next to the chat bar, is a button roughly the size of the send image button that allows you to gift nitro. This caused me to accidentally almost gift someone nitro once, and it’s an annoyance when accidentally pressing it instead of sending images. Another thing is that in private DMs, it doesn’t show if a message was read or not. I’d like an option to toggle both of these things. They are small details, but I think everyone would like to have them."
"It functions just as well as the pc version. I love the condensed link previews that pc doesn't have, however you forfeit the ability to watch a video in the app (which I personally don't mind because of the ability to remain in a voice channel and watch a video at the same time). The only change I wish they made was to make emotes a bit bigger and pictures a bit smaller because pictures can be expanded to full view. If someone posts a picture in portrait mode it would take up then entire screen. I wish they would make that change for pc as well. Maybe there could be an option for that in settings to give us more personalization. The only glitch is that if you use the autofill feature for tags and emotes, sometimes the autofill list will pop up on its own. Other than that, this app has great accessibility and works better than any other communication app I have ever used."
"I use discord all the time for things like talking to classmates and to work with them for online schooling, however there are some small bugs I would like to be fixed. One, let’s say I’m scrolling through a channel and someone sends a message below. When this happens to me, usually my screen will just teleport to another part of the channel, above or below where I was. This happens quite often to me and I hope it can be fixed. Also, sometimes when I’m scrolling left and right quickly to see members and a channel, sometimes the bar at the bottom can glitch out and show up when I’m in the channel, preventing me from typing. Although this rarely happens, I hope you will fix it. Other than those few bugs, this app is phenomenal and extremely useful and easy to use. :)"
"UPDATE; New update fixed this! Thank you! Discord is back to 5 stars.

I have done everything to try to fix this problem I have researched for days for solutions and NOTHING HAS WORKED. On my iPad Pro when I join a voice chat, everything can be heard EXCEPT MY VOICE. If I tap my iPad the indicator circle goes green. If I physically touch iPad it others can hear it they say I’m shuffling. But I speak or even try screaming into the mic no green light indication shows and they say they can’t hear me taking. FOR WEEKS I AM UNABLE TO PARTICIAPE IN VOICE CHAT. I’ve tried other chats I’ve tried other channels it’s happening in every one. This needs to be fixed. Everything fine on all my other apps the mic works I speak I hear it get feedback the problem is DISCORD. I’ve fiddled with the settings it is not on my end it is on yours. FIX THIS NOW."
"I sent in a customer support ticket a few days ago regarding the problem I run into when uploading GIFs. Copy and paste only works from a GIF keyboard, but c & p from any other website, as well as uploading, just only shows the first frame of the GIF without any animation. This has been a problem for several people and it seems like they’re not even working to prioritize it, given their twitter account. They don’t even have an ETA which is ridiculous considering that so many of their users are on iOS. The label they have regarding the problem is classified as “Will be fixed eventually”, which just gives off the connotation of them not caring. Not having an ETA for such a massive community is frustrating. Not all of us have access to desktop computers or even a laptop. I just wish Discord could get its act together for once instead of focusing on UI changes, for example. This review will probably disregarded anyway. It’s unfortunate that for such a great app, their priorities are someone else. Seems like true “discord” to me, at least."
"Discord offers a type of communication you won’t get in many other places. The people and things you can do is amazing! You can meet and connect with people of similar interests, make new friends, and talk to some old friends! 

There’s probably no boundaries when it comes to Discord. The high quality meme sharing is phenomenal, and the fun you can have while decorating your own is server is amazing! You’ll meet all kinds of people on this platform, some with similar likings as you, some who have different likings. You can learn to like new things because of the variety of people!

I have been using Discord for about a year now and I definitely do not regret it. I’ve learned to like different things and not be so antisocial. If you’re looking for a place to to practice communication skills and make some new friends, then Discord is the place for you!"
"Don’t get me wrong, I love using discord but ever since July of this year discord will not load my messages, or anything in that matter. I try logging out because I have hope that it will work and it refreshed but I put my info in and it just loads. Loads for a very long time and I can’t get in. It happens for a while, and it takes a few months to actually log me in, and it only works for about a week and the same thing happens. It always says something like ‘oops looks like you have come across a super rare error’ and it happens so often. I asked a bunch of people if this happened to them and they all said no. It’s not like I have an old phone because I’m all caught up with iOS updates and have a newer phone. It has nothing to do with WiFi either because I’m home, and I am lucky to have good internet. I hope the creators can look into this and help me because sometimes it gets out of hand and I get frustrated."
"I like this app a lot and i use it almost everyday, its fun, social, and really helps me connect to people online.
however, i have one problem with the notifications on my mobile device, ive looked through many different sites to fix the problem but have failed, i don’t know if this is a recent update that changed the way notifications are functioned, but i only receive banners when i open my phone, not when i am on other apps or outside of the app itself, not sounds, not banners, no anything. If the developers of discord can help me out with the notifications, I will be more happy if you can make changes to the notifications of the app, please contact me if you have any information on what I can do to fix the problem. nonetheless i really enjoy this app however the notifications need to be more, well, notifying."
"I use Discord a lot. I have a nitro subscription and use a few shared emoji servers with some friends, who mostly communicate over Discord. It's a great community service to screw around in. However, the app seems to give me more trouble than it's worth. Numerous times it has bugged up and logged me out (no hacking issues or anything). If linked with your call service, it'll mute all audio in and out if you join a call before your phone rings. The emoji picker doesn't let me add emojis unless I search for them or manually type its name (so the favorites section is useless). Servers, channels, and pings I've cleared are seemingly still unread, even though desktop says they've been read

If it's your only way to contact friends on the go, then get the app. If not, I suggest you wait for them to fix it and stick to desktop. Don't bother with customer service too, as the last time I contacted them about the logging out, they told me off and said use mobile or desktop, not both"
"the updates are garbage and confusing. they don't answer support emails or accept  any widely agreed-upon suggestion. you can only put one phone number per account, which does not accommodate for alt accounts and there are so many unnecessary things about the app. It gets laggy… sometimes when I click on a channel, it’s just empty and I have to click on another channel and back on that channel to view the contents of the original channel. 

One annoying incident i had today was when they kept “detecting suspicious activity” on my alt account and requested my phone number. As such, I gave them my phone number, which in turn, removed my phone number from my other account. I logged back into my main and they “detected suspicious activity from my account”. Now take note: I wasn’t joining servers too fast, DMing people too fast, or breaking ToS in any way, shape, or form so that was a bit unexpected. I gave them another phone number, my brother’s WORKING phone number, and they literally said it was invalid. I value my main over my alt so I tried putting the phone number back on that account but it said I was changing numbers too fast. 

Now what really takes the cake is that they don't specify how fast is “too fast”. 5 minutes, 10 minutes, a day, a week, a month, you’re supposed to try “later”. 

If you had any intention on downloading this save your time and breath, and don’t."
