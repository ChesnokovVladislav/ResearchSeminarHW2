"I began my journey on Social Media on MySpace and now I‚Äôm on several different platforms. I spend about equal amount of time between Facebook and Twitter. I use FB for local and National issues and politics as well as communicating with friends. Twitter for me is used almost explicitly for expressing my views and opinions about political issues, including local, state and federal matters.

Social Media can provide excellent platforms for education, news gathering, entertainment and communication but too often censorship is interfering with free speech which will in time render these useless to the populace.

At one time Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, etc. were all ideas that became realities. Now ideas for new ways to communicate are being explored and coming into fruition with the promise of free expression. If Twitter and Facebook want to stay competitive and remain leaders in this industry my humble opinion is to return to the policies that made your platforms great."
"I reached out to the support staff over a month ago with a bug I was experiencing that would not allow me to view profiles, read threads/comments, or retweet. We went back and forth for about a week and I was informed that they had heard similar complaints. I tried all of their suggested fixed and did some troubleshooting of my own multiple times between first reaching out and writing this review now. When I responded to the support email telling me they were working on fixing the bug asking for an update, I got an automated message saying that the case had been closed, even though I am still experiencing the same issue and never saw anything close to a fix. So now I'm stuck with a timeline that skips backwards (another bug I discovered recently) and even when I can scroll, I can't do any of the things I mentioned above. I would love for someone to reach out and resolve the issue.

On a separate note, it's pretty obvious that Twitter's ""personalized"" ads/stories on the timeline and explore page are personalized to the interests and views of Twitter and not to the user, as I frequently sees stories I'm not interested in and in some cases, don't agree with or contradict my interests. But that's a completely different issue that isn't just specific to Twitter."
"‚ÄúOops something went wrong. Please try again later,‚Äù is the typical response you get when trying to resolve an issue. Twitter‚Äôs arbitrary software allows some users to abuse others with impunity, while innocuous posts or singular instances of merely ‚Äúliking‚Äù a post may get you suspended. When you try to resolve the issue, good luck. You will rarely get a human to look at your issue, only an endless circle of useless articles and login tasks which may be impossible if you run both a business account and a private account. The ‚Äúappeal‚Äù option is little more than a memory hole from which you will never get a response, or sometimes an automatically generated instant denial. Twitter does little to control spam or bots. It will disable an account but still send you email notifications linking to it, yet not permit you to login simply to unsubscribe. Deleting arbitrarily suspended accounts is nearly impossible. The user-generated content is poorly and capriciously monitored, often laden with the worst sentiments and epithets so-called humanity has to offer. If you anger someone by promoting human rights or legal reform in the wrong country, you will be locked/suspended without warning. It is a time-wasting garbage app run by those who profit from toxicity and spit on the very ‚Äòrules‚Äô they comically established."
"This platform has gone through many changes mostly changes in a progressive manner for the company and app and all affiliated entities however this place AKA Twitter this social media platform has progressed to far; much like the story of Icarus who flew too close to the sun. No one is really free anymore, even on the most ‚Äòfree‚Äô platform of the major social media apps present in today‚Äôs age. I will not lie and say ‚ÄúI love this app and I use it every day.‚Äù But I will say that I will lie and say that ‚ÄúI have hope for it.‚Äù There is many levels to which we can utilize and enjoy Twitter however the only advice I can offer is that you do not sell out and that you do not change your policies but instead start changing what you‚Äôve created i.e. cancel culture i.e. freedom i.e. expression i.e. total and complete universally excepted understanding. to put this in a more Laymans term; Devo Farelo. Aspetter√≤. Aspettare qualcosa richiede pazienza, che non ho, per qualcosa che non riesco a cogliere. Ho bisogno di aiuto, per qualcosa che non riesco a capire, devo portare il mio campione. Se sei l√† fuori in grado, per favore torna al mio fianco e sii il mio Virgilio attraverso questo primo livello dell'inferno. Una fenice emerger√† dalle fiamme della disperazione, cos√¨ tutti sorgeranno attraverso le ceneri della disperazione, del caos e dell'isteria. Tutti quelli che stanno insieme finiranno insieme. Pi√π forte solo tra le braccia dei tuoi fratelli."
"Twitter is a unique platform/company. Several other platforms have tried to compete but failed. Social Media platforms are predicated on members acquiring followers. Members can‚Äôt take followers w/ them if they switch to a competing platform. This is also unique. Most companies take care of members; if I switch from an Apple phone to a Microsoft phone, Apple doesn‚Äôt own my contacts list; I can transfer my contacts. It is this single feature, holding members‚Äô followers list hostage, that has kept Twitter in business, because Twitter is managed HORRIBLY. Twitter‚Äôs bias against, & subsequent censorship of, conservative members is HORRIFYING. If our country weren‚Äôt under siege by a coordinated & unprecedented manipulation of news & information, Twitter would be defunct. But in the end, the hubris of Twitter & most Social Media platforms, will be their be their demise. If their corruption succeeds in stealing the 2020 presidential election, they will have effectively put themselves out of business. The success of their platforms is predicated on ‚Äòconflict‚Äô and open debate. If The Left wins this election, they will have succeeded in creating an inevitable Echo Chamber. Memberships in social media platforms will be cut in half. MSM & political pundits/podcasts will be defunct. *The Right will go off The Grid *"
"Just put in an edit option. You hit delete and sometimes the edit function comes up, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt deleting everything you wrote. Now everyone has to copy and paste before making an edit making the entire process tedious. Apparently getting suspended on here for to stupidest thing while people get away saying tons of stuff with no moderation on twitters part. Seems very one sided. Appealing a suspension also takes longer than the actual suspension. Bravo Jack. Bravo. üëèüèªa 12 hr suspension is now a 96 hour suspension. It‚Äôs pretty obvious how bad the censorship is getting. Also if having a conversation is important, why silence the other side? Great way to divide a nation. Maybe jack is getting paid by China. Oh no, I might get suspended...also trump got modded and banned while people are out there stoking hate and Twitter turns a blind eye because it‚Äôs their side. No mods or bans. Twitter is ok with people spreading disinformation and one sided reporting as long as it‚Äôs from the left. Double standard. Now the Soviet Union 2.0 is spreading tyranny and violence and Twitter is ok with that because of their communist views. Also if you post something and get suspended for it, you can always screenshot what got you banned and post it. Twitter seems that acceptable."
"I've been using Twitter for a good, solid amount of time but recently a bunch of religiously motivated Tweets have been showing up on my Timeline under 'Based on your likes.' I'm not religious and have not been since I was 10 years old (did not have Twitter at this time).

I tried reporting these as Tweets I was 'not interested' in many times and they continue to show up. I'm not going to stop showing Tweets 'Based on my likes' because usually these are cats and bunnies and I like those. However the amount of religious propaganda I'm experiencing is seriously disturbing to me. Even if I did accidentally like a single religious Tweet that should not be cause for them showing up every other scroll. Additionally this should cease to happen after I report that I do not want to see these kinds of Tweets anymore. 

What kind of sick game is this? As a society it's important to not only respect our individual differences but celebrate them. If everyone operated with the same mindset we would never evolve as a community. Stop trying to not so subtly influence people into adopting an entire different set of spiritual beliefs. It's disrespectful and it's concerning. Please practice common decency and responsibility."
"So for about 2 months ‚ÄúWHO‚ÄôS BEEN VISITING YOUR PAGE?‚Äù ads ran under my account & I tweeted probably 20x at Twitter at Jack at Twitter Help or whatever it‚Äôs called & you guys completely and totally ignored me.  I explained these were not my tweets & that my account was compromised & you never responded or acknowledged my messages or the problem.

Very disappointed at how during this time you allow Trump to tweet that he won the election w/o outright calling that false....

This may be an unverified claim?  LOL.  That is highly suspect & seems to also entertain the notion that Trump could be right when he is knee deep in gaslighting and propaganda tweeting is very dangerous.

Also, since the stupid fleet function was added, videos won‚Äôt play & many pictures do not fully upload & I even updated the app yesterday & it did not help the problem.

The feeling is that you don‚Äôt care how Twitter or if Twitter works properly for regular ppl & that feeling is based on Twitter being unresponsive to my technical issues & that Twitter doesn‚Äôt do all that it can to make sure it functions properly & worst of all, you let ppl compromise the accounts of others & don‚Äôt really care & that you happily spread dangerous misinformation of the Nazi variety & it makes me feel bad that I rely so much on the app & the app is completely unresponsive to me whether it be being hacked, videos and pics I can‚Äôt access, or as a dangerous propaganda tool.

Sincerely,
Marc Donato"
"Twitter can be a love or hate relationship but all depending on how you use Twitter and all of its features. It‚Äôs a social media powerhouse! Our groups love it! We are engaged and our specific hashtags #CRE #CREcommunity #CREfam #womenincre etc., and, the lists that we‚Äôve created over the years keep us in the know and connected worldwide. We‚Äôve shared our commercial real estate deals, we‚Äôve applauded our Wins and the Wins of our community, and shared our frustrations with deals not done, who we are in business and life. We have our #CREinfluencers who take it to the next level with additional engagement, Summits, take-aways, and the like. How could we possibly do all of this without Twitter? Other apps have not provided the same exposure and daily interactions as well as Twitter has for communication, being seen and heard in our daily feeds‚Ä¶just follow the hashtags. üëèüëèüëèüòò"
"Certified accounts for government officials and anyone seeking any elected office should be prohibited on Twitter.  
From the POTUS all  the down to the bottom rung of local government;   elected, appointed,  contracted or volunteered officials who are in a position to influence, or seeking to influence  anything  regarding public policy should not be permitted to convey their opinions, thoughts or messages via this platform.    Why?
If Twitter reserves the right to cancel accounts for a perceived violation of community guidelines then this platform is using its social media reach to influence public opinion.  Which is fine, however it should be available to them all.  If it isn‚Äôt, then it should not be available to any.  
This also includes any Government agencies or publicly funded services.  Official web pages should be the only platform permitted to communicate with the public.  Twitter should in no way be an official communication platform for any public agency.  Unless those agencies and their agents are exempt from censorship by the platform.  There is no middle ground or gray area. If the were vetted to receive the certified designation then they are exempt from censorship until they are no longer in that position."
"I truly believe that twitter happens to be the worst (popular) social media app. It‚Äôs the most frustrating thing when you have random accounts popping up in your feed that you never followed or searched to begin with. There‚Äôs also nothing but ads and suggested accounts. There‚Äôs no easy way around this either! The only thing I could think of was to block every single account that comes up in my feed, but c‚Äômon, how feasible is that? I wanted to try twitter, but I can never open it now because of how much my feed is filled with accounts and activity I don‚Äôt follow/ am not interested in; opening the app and seeing all that stuff now just ticks me off. I also get notifications for tweets and accounts that I don‚Äôt care about/never interacted with! I searched and searched for how to work around both of these extreme nuisances but found no quick and or easy fix. It‚Äôs a shame‚Ä¶ it has potential to be a great app, but their features and the way they designed everything is pure trash, the way they force ads and other peoples account activity into your feed. Imagine following 10 people but seeing 20 people or more in your feed‚Ä¶"
"I enjoy the platform on a whole.  The other accounts really make it interesting and fun.  What I DONT like:  The platform has OBVIOUS BIASES.  I have had my account restricted SEVERAL times because I defended myself against an obvious troll in the site.  These troll accounts- no matter how harassing- racist- bulling they are - still remain. I get told that I ‚Äúviolated‚Äù some rule.. Whereas the person harassing me hasn't violates anything.  The biases about Covid and people‚Äôs right to choose to vax or NOT.. is also obviously against your policy- when discussing medical choices and options- users  should be able to discuss a pandemic publicly- because of Social distance social media is some people‚Äôs only form of socialization or feedback.. how unfair to take that away because your site is behind vaxxing obviously.  Your political biases are also showing like a little girls panties- You obviously support Insurrectionist and liars over decent Americans.. I won‚Äôt even get on what it‚Äôs like for ‚ÄúBlack Twitter‚Äù.. people of color on Twitter get treated just like they do in the world.. You look for ANY reason to shut us down.. forever.  So, in short.. it‚Äôs your other users that keep me.. not Twitter itself."
"Enjoyed my time on Twitter, I‚Äôve made great friends. However ! Shadow banning, and other levels of censorship are frustrating to say the least. Our mark on this world can only be attained in a limited time frame. You‚Äôve made that battle exponentially greater for conservatives....perhaps a reversal of those positions will right the wrongs. I see progressive tweets daily how conservatives/Trump supporters should be added to list, and sent to re-education camps. Many many conservative accounts are suspended daily for tweeting far less. The glory of our beautiful nation is diversity of opinion and ideology without fear of retribution. Please take time to make everyone‚Äôs experience on Twitter fair. In addition, I‚Äôve reported accounts due to pornography, how can that happen ? The A.I. technology should auto delete these disgusting actions. 

In closing, thank you for opportunity to share this review. 
Kind regards

"Tweeter, it‚Äôs perfect for me. It doesn‚Äôt just allow me to post how I feel, but motivates me as well. I feel this is because of the limited character uses and the simplicity of the post. So it‚Äôs a lot easier to post what I am feeling at that exact moment, much like a note pad, but with the ability to connect to groups,  and movements. I like to say tweeter is for those of us whose mind is always racing and active, and although we would love to share our inner thoughts we have a hard time focusing that long to do, but not on tweeter, it‚Äôs quick and easy. Unlike Facebook where so much has to be dedicated to a post you almost get lost in the presentation and forget about the original topic. That‚Äôs why I am all about tweeter!
I hope they continue to make tweeting quicker, easier, and more efficient for those like me!"
"When I search something specific for example ""iPhone 13 Pro Max"" I want to see top tweets about the iPhone 13 Pro Max, instead all of the tweets that come up are about Apple BUT not even the company Apple... any tweet with the word Apple in it so the I'm getting tweets about fruit, I'm seeing tweets about football player Eli Apple, I'm seeing tweets from people who have Apple in their name, I'm seeing tweets about Apple pie and all Apple products... literally everything related to the word ""Apple"" which is NOT what I search. I also tried searching a specific team, if I type in ""Miami Dolphins"" guess what, every tweet is about the entire NFL and every team or the animal.. barely any about the team Dolphins, it's all about the 49ers, Chiefs, Rams and Bengals. Horrible search features. If I want to read about the entire NFL and random teams I would follow the NFL topic or search NFL.. I don't need twitter forcing the search on my especially for broad things like when I type in a specific phone and I have to see tweets about freaking fruit when I didn't even type the word apple myself."
"Why do you insist on pointlessly ruining things Twitter? They keep making awful updates to drive engagement, but they end deterring users, most notably with the algorithm change. Now they just decided to change the colors such that following/ not is the opposite colors and made a new font people seem to dislike, why? Who was complains about the font and who especially was demanding they reverse colors? And that‚Äôs before mentioning their lax hate speech policies in some areas, according to Twitter, telling a Jewish person to ‚Äòget in the oven‚Äô is a ‚Äòfunny joke‚Äô, but a trans person existing is hate speech Update: even more algorithm pushing now 2 forced tabs so screen space is always taken up by essentially and ad for their algorithm and extra inconveniences to access my normal timeline, they just can‚Äôt resist screwing customers for a bit of extra ad revenue. It even directly overlaps your timeline, you are restricted from looking at the tweets of people you follow so they can instead shove more ads down your throat"
Enjoying the intellect   It‚Äôs refreshing to text with so many diverse and knowledgeable people. My only regret is I‚Äôm not remembering enough of my French classes and that I did not try Twitter sooner. I prefer it   I wonder how I didn‚Äôt realize that I didn‚Äôt need the other social media. Dare I say that except for my earlier texts I have to state that I find it interesting and not at all unintelligent. Thank You for the opportunity to both rate and review it. I‚Äôm honestly quite surprised at the intellect and deeply enjoy the human discourse thoroughly and with that said let us continue to come together to express our concerns and meet the challenges we face daily head on as mature and vastly different as our cultures will hopefully not that far in the near future be more attuned to one another‚Äôs lifestyles and concerns for our fellow man and our planet. Thank You
"This App what I believed is For ,  those to Put down how they believe what or how they See to One‚Äôs Opinion? What makes you or I rt because we Follow the Parade ?? I Feel one shouldn‚Äôt be Banned or H8TD because they retort in Negative/Positive Way ?? But in a Way that helps us all release Anxiety or other emotions that we have built up inside!! That‚Äôs why we all have an activity option? To either see how many agree ? Or How many you can Purposely Wind up ? Of course there are those who live for HTRD ? But there‚Äôs also those that Love , Respect/ Defend üá∫üá∏ to All Enemies Foreign or Domestic  ! So This App is another example of WAR ?? But on Social Media ! OPINION is The WEAPON of Choice !

"Twitter is an easy method to develop polarized views. I really wish they would try to fight the polarization of media, but instead, they continue using algorithms that further influence people‚Äôs views to one side. Twitter needs to understand they and many other social media platforms are destroying the middle ground to any opposing views by showing one side of either story based on past interactions. If someone on the right continues watching right leaning videos on social media, they will only further the divide in the country. Same goes with left leaning individuals. Twitter needs to stop providing certain viewers with certain videos of influence. It causes so much harm to society. A simple solution would be to consider creating a different algorithm for political content, so they can continue having plenty of interactions but mitigate the issues of creating polarized individuals. I really hope this long review and simple minded solution don‚Äôt go to waist as it could help with the main issues we face. Thank you!"
"I used to love twitter‚Äîof all major social media platforms it seemed the most rooted to its original purpose, and i appreciated how it didn‚Äôt add a plethora of additional unnecessary features or drastic layout changes that were clearly to designed to boost advertising at the expense of user experience. But, the latest update has completely ruined this. The format change-with left aligned text, full screen videos and photos, and little demarcation between tweets‚Äîmakes the app messier, harder to read, and less unique. The wide screen photos and images ruin the app‚Äôs former clean layout and completely alter the way visual information is communicated. The overall effect is an inauthentic, ugly userface that clearly communicates a lack of 1) media literacy or 2) care of user experience. Would love if they would go back to the old layout, or at the very least give users a heads up when a change was coming rather than automatically altering without warning. 
tldr; hate the new update in a way words cannot fully capture"
"I love the content and have many interactions with old friends and new friends on Twitter. However, i only give 4 stars because of the random technical difficulties I have with twitter. One being i can rarely open the drafts folder, sometimes it works other times (seemingly the important times) it will freeze loading drafts and the app will crash or ill have to reopen the app, to which drafts is still unusable. Also the video player has issues. Sometimes it freezes. Earlier today it continually paused the video on its own instantly after i would touch play it would pause. Eventually like an hour later i tried again and the video played. I‚Äôve had other issues with the video player. Overall i enjoy twitter those small technical difficulties being my main problems."
"To whom it may concern,

First, I want to say that twitter is often a place where me and my friends come to get confirmation about any major News that is happening or that had happen, weather it‚Äôs  big event or small, weather it‚Äôs close to home or around the world.

In my humble opinion I believe that Twitter‚Äôs hush tag is the best feature about this app. By combining all the users ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs opinion‚Äù in one place is amazing, and is something no other media platform can do better than Twitter. But what make this experience unlikable is the fact that too many users use fake accounts to spread false information and bully other users because know they can‚Äôt be ‚Äúseen‚Äù. This is big problem because one fake page can bully 100 real accounts in one day, and if they stopped using Twitter it will be detrimental to this platform.

 As a computer scientist I know solving this problem is not that difficult. Sometimes the solution for the toughest problem already exist somewhere else, our job is to find it and implement it.

I wish Twitter would adopt some of methods ‚Äúdating app‚Äù already have in place to verify if the user‚Äôs account is real by asking the user for a front camera selfie and compare to their profile picture.

Sincerely,
Vanderley"
"Best platform best thing better then Facebook. Please keep Twitter alive change boot screen make it more nice then just a blue background with a white bird. Make it more easy for fans and better Facebook is so yesterday. Please also make better reply boxes do we don‚Äôt feel confused on were we need to reply a tweet also the gifs are a little crazy they need a better way at saying how they feel not cursing or stuff. Please upgrade the twitter boot screen it needs a new bird logo the current one is getting kinda old we need twitter looking more refreshed. Good app I wish they can say more what update is I wish also they updated the start up screen. Also please make twitter better and for tweet deck please fix the error of ""user is suspended"" good servvice make changes please make it better"
"As a millennial having been born in the early 80‚Äôs I have the viewpoint from a world originally without the broad connection of the internet. To see the world become so connected and so much smaller and more convenient is like watching the planet mature right in front of my eyes; It‚Äôs breathtaking. 

Apps like Twitter give everyone a podium to design as your own with which to stand upon and as followers increase your crowd becomes larger, but your also part of others crowd. Anything important to you, anything that drives your life and fuels your heart, can be shared or supported from your couch. This positive greatly outweighs most negatives which are usually the fault of the human condition. 

We all have to let each other have a podium even if we disagree and that is a challenge, but good too, because otherwise you wouldn‚Äôt even know who to disagree with. My only real personal issue other than the nastiness of some due to human condition is the fact that it‚Äôs hard to hit that like button when I don‚Äôt necessarily agree with the tweet. I am still missing those reaction buttons from Facebook letting anyone know whether I am happy or sad or angry about the information I am subjected to and a similar format would be great. 

Still those small issues don‚Äôt outweigh the connection and platform for me and I would love to see the whole world of people so close. Thank you!"
"A quick review
Twitter is an excellent place to exchange views, understand each other‚Äôs view, and develop tolerance. It also helps you in critical thinking though it limits your words. But you can always no your posts. You have an access to those person whom you can never met though you are not sure that they have even read the post or returned through their staff hired for this purpose. Twitter gives you a quick access to daily news and what is happening in the world. It has bring the world together.
The problems met
1. Hate speeches by people.
2. False propaganda against individuals and countries.
3. Fake accounts.
4. Hacking of accounts though it never happened with me.
5. Offensive posts against religion and on sex, though there is a mechanism to check it.
6. If you put posts many times because the issue is near to your heart then the Twitter start seeing you as a robot.
7. Do not know how to increase the following. Tried but could not.
8. From where we can resolve issues. There should be a support system where we can directly place our problems.
9. Vulgar and abusive language.
10. It can devastate lives of people, can be used to influence governments, regime change, disinformation, spy operations, propaganda against individuals and countries, create anarchy.
11. Can even make you a star."
"IF THEY WOULDN‚ÄôT SUPPORT CHRISSY TEIGAN THERE‚ÄôS NO CHANCE FOR US. I‚Äôve been a Twitter user since 2012 (@steffyjsays). I have a small following and I mostly use it to retweet jokes and some news. My account was suspended on December 21, 2020 with zero prior offenses for a tweet about the Negro Solstice which was the top trend that day thanks to Black Twitter. The reason given was use of hate speech. Had the subsequent ‚Äúreview‚Äù been properly done, it would‚Äôve been clear that I am a Black woman and the artist I tagged (Missy Elliot) actually follows me. I can cite dozens if not hundreds of similar tweets that not only weren‚Äôt flagged but some made it to news articles. 
My account was not restored after the standard 14 days. I‚Äôve since appealed to Twitter support THREE MORE TIMES and received only one response that the suspension was being upheld unless I deleted the tweet. IT HAS BEEN THREE MONTHS NOW. They‚Äôre able to silence BIPOC immediately but racists and misogynists can say what they want for years. How is tech support so bad they ran their biggest celebrity user off the app completely!? SAVE YOURSELF THE HEADACHES AND HEAD TO CLUBHOUSE."
"Such a large platform which hides behind the statement of being a platform for free speech, yet acts like a publisher censoring everything that doesn‚Äôt fit with the CEO and employees narrow anti American viewpoint. Twitter will slap a fact check banner across your post half the time using a fact that has nothing to do with your post, only that it doesn‚Äôt align withTwitter‚Äôs political viewpoint.  If you‚Äôre lucky, you will fly under the radar of the cancel culture employees who will gleefully delete your profile for no other reason than that you hold conservative values.  They have been seen on camera openly bragging about this.  Take a look at how the CEO  speaks to Senators when they are questioning him as they are trying to investigate as to whether Twitter is censoring people.  One minute he speaks arrogantly as if he is above them while the next, he acts like he doesn‚Äôt understand simple yes no questions.  

If you really wish to support a company such as this, be my guest, but users are leaving in droves and you will probably be alone."
"At first I only got Twitter to see what was going on in the world. Through it I got to meet new people and have interesting conversations. All was well, then Everything started getting political and thuggish. People started bashing others simply for having different opinions, people were calling others racist because they didn‚Äôt support certain factions or ideals. I was even harassed simply for defending my ideals. I didn‚Äôt mean any harm to others, I didn‚Äôt call for someone‚Äôs death, I only fought for my freedom to speak my mind even if most disagreed with it. Twitter itself did Nothing to defend me or others in my place. It has proven to be biased time and time again to catering to the mob and backing issues that are clearly against its own guidelines. Twitter and other Social Media has become incredibly polluted with hatred, death, and lies. I will no longer support this media and others like it. Having other opinions is fine and any disagreements can be discussed with civility and respect. There is none of it here."
"Censorship is horrible. Any free speech that doesn‚Äôt fit agenda of liberal media is canceled. Hate speech is good to cancel, but opposing viewpoints‚Ä¶analogies can be made but we will lose our democracy without equal time for non-hateful views and data.  I Use Twitter and also a long time stock holder but company leadership is failing me and our country.  Very discouraged, I‚Äôm a registered democrat with conservative views and socially progressive for those willing to work for opportunities. So when I say I‚Äôm disappointed I‚Äôm not at all unique. Twitter is failing the Silent majority who believes in working and helping hands, not handouts. If business is allowed to continue censorship of opposing views, this country and all the people it provides opportunities for will eventually fail.  

Tech issue.  Allow everyone to edit existing posts for typos or context they immediately regret. We are all human in both of this cases. If you are worried about tracking bad actors history just allow editing for 5 or 10 minutes. We usually notice our typos right after posting."
"A little bird told me that one day I would be part of a military operation with a mission to save lives and rebuild communities rather than end them.

"Twitter is full of cow Dung‚Ä¶ They automatically suspended people over something trivial like usage of swear words‚Ä¶.

"This used to be my favorite social media site. I downloaded this app for mostly sports and entertainment purposes. This site has become viciously politically driven in the worst way possible. The restrictions placed on some but not others is disappointing.  Some are allowed to spew hate, lies, etc  with zero repercussions - and it goes on and on while others are suspended or blocked.  It doesn‚Äôt matter what ‚Äúside‚Äù you‚Äôre on.  Can‚Äôt have it both ways.  I see very little entertainment or friendly banter with anyone on here anymore.  When I do login it‚Äôs brings frustration, disappointment, and exhaustion. There‚Äôs just no joy in being in it anymore.  I‚Äôm still deciding personally on keeping or deleting Twitter.  Our company is currently in discussion about their stance on Twitter and others social media platforms."
"As an old-timer I find the app easy to use and understand. The medium is controversial, but the software is excellent on iPhone and very seldom do I encounter problems. Twitter can be a source for major breaking news, and my feed includes winners of Pulitzers, a Nobel or two, and a gaggle of intelligent, encouraging followers. There are little tricks you have to learn, especially if you need more characters; but that also makes you a better editor and a more concise writer. The problems with bots, fake accounts, flaming, and such date back to the old days of Compuserve, Prodigy, and AOL, so that‚Äôs not new. However, the corporate titans should stop the flow of disinformation from hostile and malignant sources, if only we could figure out how. Again, I highly recommend the app as easy to learn and easy to use. Cheers - Tüëçüèº"
The website needs more characters to clearly communicate a message. Twitter is a place for conversation now and not always just a short message where you have to rearrange your word choices and cut words out or you make a tweet and it‚Äôs just a character or two over. It‚Äôs annoying and also needs an edit button. I like the minimalist user interface but don‚Äôt like the suppression of free speech and the political censorship is irresponsible and an awful business practice especially for a company the magnitude of Twitter. Jack I hope you see this and stop letting your company boss you around. It‚Äôs like you can‚Äôt even speak anything meaningful on the platform you created. I‚Äôd like to hear more from you and also hear your thoughts on why Twitter has grown increasingly draconian and censors. Censorship has created a toxic and biased culture of racists and name calling. There‚Äôs so much more potential for Twitter but it‚Äôs only a matter of time before it‚Äôs irrelevant. I‚Äôd rather not see it go that way and would love to see twitter improve. Bless.
"I like the concept of micro-blogging and how it allows you to share posts, articles, and images. However, the community removes the enjoyment of all that. The endless line of harassment, racism, and hatred that I have experienced on the app genuinely makes me mad to the point where I cannot enjoy browsing Twitter anymore. Categories such as politics, sports, fandoms, and even memes of all things are just followed up by pointless arguments and bullying. I‚Äôm constantly reporting all these accounts that harass others, but I‚Äôm not even sure if reporting works, because Twitter doesn‚Äôt update me on whether or not they violated their terms. The amount of misinformation spread by users in politics and other categories is also dangerous to the point where they actually reach the trending page. Even the President of the U.S. is using Twitter as a form of propaganda. If you really need to interact with others and use social media like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, be my guest, but if you want to keep your mental health in check, steer clear."
"I use Twitter a lot to follow artists and friends, but it‚Äôs very difficult to keep track of everything when the options are so limited. I see advertisements and promoted tweets way too often. There‚Äôs no Twitter Pro that I can buy to not have to see ads. The tweets I see are time-stamped, but they‚Äôre always out of order (2 minutes, 5 hours, 5 minutes, 2 weeks ago) and there‚Äôs no way to filter the tweets I see on my dashboard. I would love to be able to see only pictures or only text posts, but there‚Äôs no way to do this except for searching on a specific Twitter page. On top of this, once you scroll down a certain amount, you can‚Äôt scroll anymore so you can‚Äôt know what you missed unless you go through Twitter pages manually. I‚Äôm most disappointed about the ads, but all of the problems here are very inconvenient, annoying, and time consuming. The only reason I‚Äôm here is because all of the good artists moved here from Tumblr"
"The current state of the iOS Twitter app has deteriorated to the point where it's another Facebook or Instagram. Pushing content you don't want, and just using ""normal"" tweets to fill the gaps between promoted tweets (or whatever they call their adverts). 
Now, the latest version of the app shows a notification badge every single time I open it, and I have to visit the Direct Message tab to clear it, even though I have NO Direct Messages! What are you notifying me about? To be honest, I only use it to post, but use third party apps to read my unadulterated timeline. 
After all these years and half promises about the ""content we want"", they still don't realize that all we want is a chronological timeline with NO ADS. And, guess what? People would actually be willing to pay in-app or for a Pro version to get that! But, no. Twitter figures it makes more sense to offer a paid undo feature. What? Just close your doors and go home. No one would even miss Twitter at this point."
"I can only use Twitter for direct messaging & getting notified of some of my selected accounts in my followed set for notifications.. No one ever sees my tweets. I used to get interactions but none in more than a year of daily tweets. Now the app keeps logging me out taking so much time to log back in each time since latest IOS updates. Annoying without Touch-ID sign in & having to enter long passwords. Getting ready to stop tweeting & getting notifications elsewhere that I can rely on. Also, after writing this review no support or willingness to help even if I send a DM to Twitter support, not wanting to tweet something nasty! I am not sure who is designing, supporting or what goals the developer has for this app but I wish another developer would offer a better app to use for Twitter, not wanting to have to log in to my account every time I want to post, view notifications details or just look through my feed."
"This app used to be a staple for news and content. Unfortunately it‚Äôs now a hardcore censorship engine that evolved the app into a propaganda machine for specific political points of view pushed by Twitter Corporate Office. They‚Äôve watered down the Timeline, show popular recommended Tweets instead of Latest Tweets, they have partisan Trending News only showing terrible things about the United States President, constantly (who would allow such a thing other than foreign enemies of the USA), and the settings now filter content on a second level (hidden) which you have to shut-off to see your preferred content (outrageous).. All trending news is always slanted to favor One political party promoted also by the Twitter CEO daily. News corporations, who even claim alien spaceship parts are in Las Vegas (2017 NY Times) are given priority over citizens to ensure the broadest brainwashing of political propaganda with an emphasis on hating the United States President. Who remembers when the internet was a melting pot of diversity? Freedom of speech? Not so much anymore. Great work Twitter!"
"Private companies are private. However, Twitter is abusing their power to stifle free speech. Twitter employs selective promotional bias as to only promote narratives that fit their leftist agenda. Promotion of leftism and active stifling of any bad news for democrats ie the hunter Biden scandal. Apparently the ayatollah is allowed to call for death to Israelis and Americans but Trump is somehow uniquely evil. The ayatollah sponsored and directed ied roadside bombings which destroyed the lives killed and maimed  countless us troops. Shame on Twitter for allowing this evil man to maintain his platform. Highly offensive to veterans. But no, god forbid that trump should have a Twitter account he‚Äôs the ‚Äòreal‚Äô nazi. Good lord Twitter you have lost your mind. Trump is banned but the communist party of China who is rounding up their Muslims into concentration camps and harvesting their organs, they are allowed to have an account. Twitter is not a platform for free speech Twitter is a leftist publisher who hates conservatives and labels them as nazis but tolerates actual Islamo fascists and actual concentration camp running entities. Shame on you Twitter! Disgusting!"
"Well as you all know Twitter is a really great music platform to be on the go with, it is simple and user friendly to keep using this tell a friend support Twitter take the journey to the beginning  to the end of a trend this amazing social media site. I do remember that Twitter has been around for a while MySpace time era but don‚Äôt get it twisted 
Know that the future holds are answers to the next big thing so go to the pearly gates to get be judged by the all mighty a mega alpha  and remember when you go to them crossroads make sure you thank Twitter for ride n with you  and being at your finger tips.
Thank you for the read I got the 13  Steps coming soon I should have it in audio and bay days the homie coming get book so keep the look out for me C-LoW 
The one Directions to a ripple shift"
"I‚Äôve been using Twitter for over 3 Years so I know what to expect. But, what I didn‚Äôt expect is a suspension on an New Fresh Account?? So, I‚Äôve made disrespectful tweets on my Main Account (@CheezyMode) and when I got suspended I thought it would be appealable so I filed over 5 appeals for that Account and I haven‚Äôt gotten an response. Which is fair because we do have COVID-19. But the fact that it‚Äôs been 3 Months since I‚Äôve made those multiple appeals doesn‚Äôt really justify that. So, I decided maybe since I got suspended, I‚Äôve made some disrespectful statements, maybe I should stop appealing and just start a new Twitter Account, and this time I‚Äôd not tweet as much or be disrespectful, instead upon finishing my Twitter I Immediately got Banned. I was shadow banned! My fresh new account I made was immediately banned upon creation! It‚Äôs not fair as I only my Main Account shouldn‚Äôt have any affiliation with any new ones. 

TL;DR I got shadow banned, even though I tried making a new one it got banned too. Bad App anyways, don‚Äôt download very toxic."
"It‚Äôs a nice app for communication and keeping up with what‚Äôs new in your preferred topics; with looking past all the negatives of course.

Though, a couple weeks after I downloaded the app, it was unable to show threads and replies when I tapped on a tweet. The show more replies option appears at the top of the screen and yet when I tap on that too, nothing shows up.

Furthermore, it also doesn‚Äôt allow me to see my bookmarked tweets, showing me that nothing is there.

It‚Äôs the same when I try to look at other people‚Äôs profiles, showing me the wording that something went wrong.

What confuses me is that when I log into and use Twitter on the web browser on Safari, all of these features work. (Threads, replies, bookmarks, etc.)

This has been going on for around a month or so; I‚Äôve tried deleting the app (repeatedly and having it deleted for as long as two weeks) and reinstalling, logging out, etc.

I‚Äôve also tried using the Twitter help page and all but I couldn‚Äôt find anything useful to help these bugs going on with the app for me.

Now I don‚Äôt know if anyone else is having these problems but it does ruin the experience.

Other than that, with limited and reasonable use, Twitter is a really creative social media platform that connects a lot of people and topics for everyone to enjoy."
"Thanks to using the Twitter app as long as I have, I have created a lot of meaningful connections with folks living around the world that I wouldn‚Äôt have otherwise been able to connect with, without the Twitter app specifically. As far as social media apps go, it‚Äôs highly user friendly, has good security and privacy tools, and is a brilliant way to meet new people and make new friends online that naturally appreciate the content you put out on the app. It‚Äôs an app I use frequently as both a way to express my creativity as a kind of online gallery, and as a way to network with people I expressly wish to network with, I recommend Twitter to creative thinkers interested in creating web content and getting it seen by the right people."
"Eye Say This Because It Is The Only App That Has Not Blocked The Truth About This Biological Weapon COVID Witch Was Created To Depopulate The Population With. 
Twitter Has Help Saved Lives. While The Other Apps Have Help The Spread Of This COVID Viruses. By Shutting Down All Information Exposing The Truth About COVID. By Restricting Accounts From Being Social On Social Media. Everyone Enforcing You To Wear A Face Mask Everyone Forcing You To Test, Everyone Enforcing You To Vaccinate Is Your Enemy. They Are Part Of This Plan To Depopulate The Population. They Are Attacking Children Ages 5+. Time For You To Join This Grassroots Self-Determination Movement And Get Involve With Your Independence From These Diabolical Government Organizations. 
Eye Want To Say Thank You Twitter For Not Selling Out To Bill Gates Money. For Allowing The Truth When Other Refuse To Allow The Truth On Their Platforms."
"The iPad version is horrible compared to the iPhone version, thus why I am only giving the Twitter app a 2 star rating. I don‚Äôt care for the forced viewing of the Trends on the right side of the screen, especially since the trends are by no means close to my interests. I have tried to customize my trends, but all I can do is choose a city, with the closest to my location being Denver, which pretty much only shows sports, or I can let the Twitter AI choose what it believes my interest are, which pretty much is only sports. The problem is that I HATE most sports and most of the people I follow have nothing to do with sports. If there was a way to turn off the trends completely or have the option to actually select the trends I am interested in, I may give the app a higher rating, but until then it stays at 2. (And yes, I have gone in to my Twitter data and updated my interests, but it doesn‚Äôt do anything and when I go back in a week later, the AI has added items back that I have removed.)"
"With every update, Twitter finds a way to make their app worse. What was once my favorite Social Media is now turning into a worse version of every other platform. Instead of adding useful features, like edit buttons, they add something useless, like double tapping Tweets to like them, NFT profile pictures, or a ‚Äúcompose‚Äù button floating above the UI that blocks tweets.

Update: I wish I could give it even less stars. They‚Äôve now started to force users to view an algorithm‚Äôs selected tweets instead of the normal chronological timeline. It‚Äôs annoying, and defeats the entire appeal that Twitter used to have. Twitter used to be a site where you could view people‚Äôs concise, spontaneous thoughts and reactions to everyday occurrences and world events.
Now that it‚Äôs all out of order, how can we watch our friends live tweet their favorite shows? How can we see lives updates on presidential debates while they‚Äôre still airing?
Twitter desperately wants to be something that they can‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt be."
This was a good app that I used to use a lot. I lost my account so I had to make a new one but Twitter changed it to where I have to put in my phone number. I am personally not comfortable giving my phone number to an app but for some people who don‚Äôt have a phone number or use a phone number app like text free (which is unsupported by twitter) can‚Äôt even use the app. I think Twitter should make it where you have a choice whether you want to use email/phone number/ or both not make me have to do both. If you were to change this my rating would change. But the fact that I can‚Äôt even use it just cause I don‚Äôt want to give my phone number makes this a 1 star app. If you look in comparison Snapchat and Instagram are better than twitter because more people are able to access it not just people willing to give out there number. Now with what I said in mind if there is a way to skip putting your number in than I will apologize but as far as I can see there isn‚Äôt.
"No one respects a single intellectual that works for Twitter - none of them are established thinkers or philosophers; so it‚Äôs really quite shocking that they take it upon themselves to decide what people should and should not see. I believe we need a medium that is devoid of ideological pushes, but rather lionizes empiricism and freedom of speech in its very terms of service. Twitter is exemplary in demonstrating the need for an internet bill of rights; and I know this is an app review‚Äîbut how else will we usher in the change if not through sincere review? Bottom line: Twitter‚Äôs surface-level platitudes to CSJ, and blatant attacks to the principle of free speech, deem it one of the greatest threats to our society. If it wasn‚Äôt essentially functioning as our public square, I wouldn‚Äôt be holding them accountable. Recognize your role in all this, and change."
"Just as trump is a symptom of a diseased American electorate, so Twitter, Facebook and so many other social media are reflecting the schisms. Religious bigots, social liberals, gun nuts who would prefer arming themselves like a combat unit to feeling safe in public or their children safe in school. The divisions are in my face everyday and the ONLY thing worse is being uninformed. Having said that, I hope the day comes where social media are broken up by the government into manageable bite-size companies...accent on Manageable. FB and Twitter have slipped the bounds of any sort of control. There is actually so much falsity that Zuckerberg has all but thrown up his hands in surrender. And the lies roll on out of their shop. This next election should prove whether or not the American People can trust their sources of NEWS...you remember news don‚Äôt you? It‚Äôs what we used to be able to count on for truth without all the spin."
I‚Äôm soon going to have to take legal action since Twitter has refused to respond to any of my emails they suspended my account based off of false information on me and I appealed it then they let me login into my account as long as I can verify my email but when I seen my email it was changed when the Twitter rules say they won‚Äôt touch or sell your information yet my email was changed so there no way I can verify the account is mine I‚Äôve tried multiple times to get into my account and nothing. I spoke to my friend who is study to be a lawyer and said I can sue since they changed personal information of mine and there terms and service say they won‚Äôt I have right and standing to sue them for my information back and not only that they won‚Äôt even respond to me I‚Äôm sadden because I can‚Äôt even see my pictures and things I posted of passing family members I shouldn‚Äôt have done it but now I can‚Äôt get a hold of them because they won‚Äôt let me into my account I‚Äôm truly disappointed and distraught
"I‚Äôve been using Twitter since it first came out and I was so amazed at house much I could learn about what‚Äôs going on around the world in real time. It was a game changer back then and it still is now. Every social platform has bugs from time to time, ALL of them. That‚Äôs just how technology works. But I‚Äôll say Twitter has the best response time in regards to anything, not limited to fixing bugs in such a quick manner. It‚Äôs also the only social media platform that TRULY allows you free speech. They don‚Äôt take down offensive posts nearly as often as Instagram and Facebook, only if they cross a verrrryyyyy big line. Not saying that‚Äôs the type of Tweeter I am, I am all for equality and Twitter also has one of the most diverse users. Long story short üòÇüòÇüòÇ give this a try, it‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre used to, but it‚Äôs equally as awesome. ü§™ü§ìüôå"
"CountJackula has had their account suspended due to mass reporting by self-proclaimed white supremists. I can‚Äôt share any evidence because you took down all the tweets. It is 100% that stating that you are against these attitudes and ideologies can result in the loss of your platform, creating fear and suppression. The fact that you punish those who are against racism and not those for makes twitter complicit. Restore Count Jackula‚Äôs twitter or I will be forced to move to other social media to show my content since you have proven that your censorship is unsafe for someone like me. Making my account private stunts the growth of my content and product.  I am a queer,disabled, Jewish socialist and I am the primary target of a lot of these racists. If you protect them and not my allies you make it clear to me that this app provides no safety in my attempt to expand my platform. Any negative reaction to my complaint further targeted at count Jackula or at me will be seen as retaliation and further proof of complicity, and grounds for legal action."
"I‚Äôve been using Twitter for years, and it‚Äôs become apart of my daily routine. I‚Äôve been very satisfied and pleased with the changes and improvements the team has made over the years, especially Bookmarks and Moments. Recently, however, the app will randomly freeze and crash. I‚Äôve never had this problem with the app until one week ago. It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating as once the app crashes, it kinda ‚Äúresets‚Äù everything. Also, when I go to search for old tweets of my account (which is private) or my friends‚Äô account (that are on private) using specific keywords, either the most recent tweet appears or no tweets appear at all. This is likely a glitch, I believe? Anyways, like I said, I‚Äôve been using Twitter for years so despite these bugs and glitches, I still provide 4 stars. Thanks for all that you do."
"If you use Twitter for more than just retweeting and liking other people‚Äôs tweets- I‚Äôm sure you have come across the hindering effect that the very short character count has on unverified accounts. Tweeting with links to articles and such can be quite challenging due to the limitations of the character count.

Spaces, characters in the links you are pasting to the tweet, and people you are tagging should absolutely NOT be included in the total character count; this just takes away from the ability to include important information in the tweet itself.

This is an incredibly user-friendly app that allows for countless abilities to connect with other people- that is why I am giving it 4 stars, because other than the fact that blank spaces and characters contained in links count as total characters affected by the limitations, this app is perfect."
"FB just came out saying their system is having a glitch today and marking many viral and non-viral links as spam and removing them unintentionally, but now Twitter is telling me all of my accounts have problems and I need to add phone numbers to them?! What‚Äôs the point in letting us sign up and not enter in a number nor require to have a cell phone number to being with if you‚Äôre gonna force us to use our numbers anyways. I have to log in to more than a handful of accounts, but can‚Äôt do my job bc my number is already on my personal account.

I have read the rules over and over again and they say each number can be used for up to 10 accounts, but now my accounts have went from telling me my number is already in use to a week later being suspended. I have contact/ appealed all of them but all I keep getting is an automated email. 

This is making WFH extremely difficult, need to be staying connected with my customers and not blocked from the accounts."
"Great application. I use it a lot for personal & also professional usage. As part of my work, I make extensive usage of the list features. I have few public, and servers curated private lists to keep up with different information flows. I would love to see the ability to with the click of a button or setting...turn on/off push notifications for a particular public or private list or lists of users. This would allow me to disable notifications from a number of accounts on my off days when I don‚Äôt need to be connected as much, but also give the ability to quickly turn on a list when I head back in to work or am working from home. I don‚Äôt know if anyone has ever requested this feature, but I sure would love to see it. Again, great application. Definitely my top social media choice."
"Of all my social media accounts this one seems to be the better one. What I mean is as a southern conservative I don‚Äôt get censored  like I do on IG and facebook.  Its nice to be able to have freedom of speech without the political police shutting you down because of your conservative views.  However, if you are on the other side of the political spectrum you can say whatever you wish and nothing is done.  The hypocrisy is mind blowing at best and it pisses me off that every media outlet is censoring us.  News flash to all media outlets we the people are not going anywhere and we to will have our voices heard and will not be silenced anymore. Thank you twitter for allowing others to hear our voices. I know Twitter has its  negatives but so far I have had positive experiences. God Bless America üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏"
"Twitter will prove to be one of the biggest failures in the social media world.  They have taken what could have been a long-term outstanding platform for free speech & turned it into a political propaganda machine!  

If Twitter does not like who you are, what you stand for or what you say their standard response is to cut you off.  With never clear reasons they try to silence everyone they disagree with.

As the 2020 elections fade from view the drumbeat of people demanding a more objective platform free of political control gets louder & louder.  The first platform to have open dialogue with no interference from the corporate office will win out.  Then Twitter will tank since most Americans still highly prize their freedom of speech rights.  Twitter‚Äôs prime goal turned into silencing the rights of any & all conservative viewpoints as fast as they can.  This past 5 years have proven that.  So I, along with many many others, bid Twitter adieu & hope that other companies will censure Twitter in the same way Twitter has done to so many others!"
"When you decide to let ME control MY timeline I'll start using your app again, until then I'll be using a different app. I hate the ""In case you missed it"", and I don't want too see what everyone else likes, if I want to see that, I'll look at their profile. The most important thing, stop automatically scrolling to the top of my timeline. You're trying to be too much like Facebook, I don't use it for all of these reason. Please give me control of my timeline. Why is it so hard to simply show me things in chronological order?

Update: while they have stopped automatically scrolling my timeline to the top, I don‚Äôt want to see what everyone else likes in my timeline. I also would prefer it to just show everything in chronological order vs me seeing ‚Äúin case you missed it‚Äù 
It really can‚Äôt be that hard to at least give us options for this stuff. Until all this is fixed, I‚Äôll continue using an alternate app, and Twitter will loose its add money."
"If you get Twitter, don‚Äôt delete it. I know when you FIRST start out it‚Äôll seem uninteresting or useless but I PROMISE YOU it‚Äôs worth it. Twitter consists of the BEST most relatable quotes (and if you want something SPECIFIC type it in the search bar and you‚Äôll see where multiple people most likely said that same thing before) It has all the latest trending topics, it‚Äôs a space where you can be yourself... no restrictions just raw. When you follow the right people ? I promise you once you get on Twitter you might as well grab you some snacks because you‚Äôre not getting off for a whileeee ü§£ it‚Äôs very possible to be so hooked that you‚Äôll go from the tippy top of your timeline to the very bottom üò≠ FYI: The threads and story times make it soo much better so explore and enjoy ‚ÄºÔ∏èü§©"
"Do you want a chronological feed? They are constantly innovating to find new ways to make it harder to look at one‚Äîand to add new steps to make it more of a hassle to see. It‚Äôs no longer even a preference you can turn on... now you WILL be forced to actively opt back into a chronological view every time you open the app. Do you want to clear your feed of ‚ÄúIn Case You Missed It‚Äù, ‚ÄúPeople You May Know‚Äù, ‚ÄúPeople You Should Follow,‚Äù ‚ÄúTweets By People You Don‚Äôt Follow‚Äù, and other such garbage? They give you the option to select ‚Äúsee less often‚Äù (no option to see never, mind you)‚Äîand this has no apparent effect at all... you will still see all of these things frequently. They also treat you to incredibly dumb new notifications that you can futilely ask to see less often (e.g., a tweet that is already in your feed as a notification). They have behaved like this for years, so I don't see much hope that they will ever stop treating their users with contempt."
"Trying to submit feedback through the app is nearly impossible. The options are limited to serious allegations (abuse, copyright infringement, impersonation, etc.) Twitter apparently only wants my opinions on the app if some other user is the direct culprit of the offense. 

I don‚Äôt mean to say that the app is terrible; I am a frequent user and enjoy much of my experience. But there are some glaring issues with which tweets are included or excluded, particularly in comment sections. I‚Äôd prefer if the algorithm were more democratic (likes-> uprank), yet I can‚Äôt make any sort of nuanced case using the feedback system in-app. It‚Äôs either a scathing condemnation of another user or shut up and swallow the system as is. Maybe the rule-makers over at Twitter should consider how this system skews complaints toward the extreme."
"Looks like Twitter forgot what the 1st Amendment stands for! I‚Äôll bet they know what the 2nd Amendment stands for. Got SO SICK of their ‚Äúpick and choose‚Äù BS policies. What‚Äôs perfectly okay for one person to tweet, is NOT okay for another person? I believe that Twitter is clearly too far Right and much too Conservative. I also believe that Twitter is, shall we say ‚Äúselective‚Äù with ‚Äúwhere members are from and possibly, their ‚Äúheritage.‚Äù For example, in all the time I‚Äôve been a member, I can count on one hand how many Muslims, American or not, are even members, no less allowed to tweet. They suspended my account for the fourth time?! I just said, whatever already. They don‚Äôt even bother to tell you why. Unbelievable. Not worth their unfair, inane prejudices. Have left Twitter for good, moved on and glad I did!!"
"My account was breached and hacked into, that person then spammed advertisements which caused my account to be suspended under my name. Of course like anyone would, I tried to email support to help unsuspend my account especially since this happened on my birthday. Contacted them and waited for 2 weeks, get an automated message saying they basically didn‚Äôt do anything and ‚Äúhoped‚Äù I received help, in which it says to contact if I still had ‚Äúissues‚Äù which I clearly do of course. So I appeal again which the system picks up as the same case appeal I made before , and now it‚Äôs been 3 appeals later , 2 months from now and still no help or assistance on my suspended account. It actually bothers me that this would happen on my birthday as well as with Twitter. I loved Twitter over most social media‚Äôs but after having this experience with a support team, when I see support teams that can email me back within hours to days, is just a disappointment to me for communication and help."
"Twitter has a big problem. It does not respect its user base. It is not sufficient in twitter‚Äôs view to simply have an age restriction (18+) and then respect adult users‚Äô ability to read content and responsibly come to their own conclusions. Instead, twitter censors politicians, journals, media outlets, etc to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù users on the platform. It is not simply blocking ‚Äúdisinformation‚Äù. It is more important than ever that free speech be protected so that people can point out corruption and speak out of against abuse of governments and institutions. It is dangerous for society when corporations have control over the flow of information. It inevitably will be controlled in a biased manner ‚Äî whether it be sooner or later. Twitter thinks it is protecting its users from ‚Äúdisinformation‚Äù ‚Äî which is very often a matter of opinion. Instead twitter needs to protect ITSELF from abusing society by restricting free speech. It should constitute rules within its company to prevent this and stop censoring people. Anyone who is classically liberal should recognize this."
"I can only speak for my experiences and a statistical significant multitude of others. If you love America, my recommendation is to Go to Parler. It‚Äôs on the App Store. At least on Parler sarcasm is recognized as part of the American way of communication along with Satire. During this past election cycle Twitter showed it does not allow simple forms of sarcasm or Satire. America was founded on diversity. Communism was founded on control and submission. Parler is America. I see Twitter as Communist North Korea. One good thing remains though, if you don‚Äôt like something you can at least, for now, not be forced to participate.  Sadly, I don‚Äôt know how long that freedom to chose what you like will last.  I don‚Äôt have to have social media to find peace and contentment. I certainly don‚Äôt have to be treated unfairly in the form of shadow banning and participatory censorship by Twitter for expression of humor in the form of satire and sarcasm.  I have no confidence in the leadership and culture of Twitter to be fair and provide an equal treatment environment."
"Twitter would be better for me if there was an option to block all hashtags created by a large group of people. I‚Äôm specifically talking about this korean fandom called ARMY. This fandom trends hashtags many times a day. Yes, I blocked their names and anything associated with the fandom so I won‚Äôt see it on my timeline. But... I can still see hashtags. This is becoming very repetitive and tiring to see. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs tiring for many people that‚Äôs not a fan of korean pop as well. I just want to keep up with news and things that interests me, but these hashtags are annoying. Please do something about it. It would be great to deal with the fandom situation. Twitter is infected with korean pop fancams & yes they‚Äôre under random articles and videos. There should be a setting to completely block it right? Turning off auto-play isn‚Äôt enough for me. Please do something about it."
"I am deeply disgusted with the biased censorship Twitter has been enforcing on American People. Twitter(Jack) is not the ruler of our nation. This ‚ÄòBIG CORPORATION/MEDIA BROADCAST COMPANY‚Äô and their internal ‚Äústatues‚Äù do NOT take precedence over the constitution and the rights to which it bestows upon us; OUR FREEDOM OF SPEECH. Now although there is certain ‚Äúhateful‚Äù speech that in ‚Äúgood faith‚Äù should be examined and/or censored, it‚Äôs not practical or efficient for you as a business to ‚Äúpick and choose‚Äù when and how you want to interpret ‚Äúgood faith‚Äù. It‚Äôs not fair that you are using words like ‚ÄúGood Faith‚Äù that are supposed to have a clear moral understanding and a a bipartisan mutuality, to justify your biased, dictatorial and dare I say PETTY censorship‚Äôs of American FREE SPEECH. You are manipulating a whole generation of people into becoming your slaves. I refuse to be a slave in this ‚Äòfree‚Äô country. I pray that Jack gets his Act together real quick, before he gets a rude awakening. Americans may be allowing it now cause TROUBLE DON‚ÄôT LAST ALWAYS. Americans will fight back for our rights!! Especially the First one!!"
"The direction that Twitter and social media is headed is extremely concerning and I am honestly not sure why people are okay with it. Twitter is blatantly censoring users from expressing their thoughts and opinions. It sounds extreme, but we are honestly moving towards a society that I do not want to be a part of. Twitter is not letting us freely express ourselves and if it goes against what Twitter believes, than you cannot be heard. Our nation was built upon this idea of freedom and Twitter is turning its back on our core values. Twitter is a toxic environment where I am bullied because I republican. I am called a racist and bigot because I am republican but I know who I am and it is definitely not those things. It enrages me that people can say they know my heart and intentions when only I know who I truly am."
"A truly awful application that they keep managing to make worse  in large and small ways. Kudos on the innovation required to make even the display of ‚Äúlikes‚Äù into the visual equivalent of a hovering mosquito! Twitter has one useful function ‚Äî displaying short, timely posts of a selected group of people in chronological order ‚Äî and they have been trying to destroy that one function for years. With the latest round of updates, I think they‚Äôve finally done it. Their concept of ‚Äúhome,‚Äù showing random  posts by random people in random order, reveals the developer‚Äôs true goal: chaos. They want nothing less than the destruction of order itself, and to make their point clear, they shuffle the posts *while you are reading them*. The only reasons I can see that twitter still exists is 1) it is the chosen platform of a raving would-be dictator, and 2) ‚Äúat least it‚Äôs not Facebook. Will their striving for chaos finally overcome the network effect, erasing them from our lives and memories? We can only hope."
"I like Twitter. It‚Äôs the only social media I really use. However, for sometime, when I report abusive behavior, my reports are automatically denied. I believe it started happening after I reported targeted harassment and violent threats sent to me and my friends. I don‚Äôt receive notifications anymore about reports, only emails saying no rules were broken. 

I have reported targeted harassment, bigotry including racist and homophobic slurs, misinformation, violent threats including videos of a fugitive wanted by the FBI for the January 6th attack at the US Capitol threatening people with a knife and talking about how he murdered people. The fugitive was live tweeting these videos while he was harassing people. For all of these reports I received emails saying no rules were broken.

I was asked for more information about the targeted harassment toward me and my friends. I sent links to tweets including entire threads of this harassment. Some of these were to me. Some were sent to others. They ask for tweets sent to others if they are also harassing others. I was told that they needed reports from the accounts involved to do anything. Yet, I told them I was harassed and sent them the tweets sent to me.

I know my reports are being automatically denied, because my friends report some of the same accounts and they receive reports saying rules were broken and those accounts were locked or suspended."
"It‚Äôs too politically charged nowadays. It used to be a place where people could share what they ate for dinner or what their pets did. Now it‚Äôs completely political and if you don‚Äôt fit a certain agenda they boot you. As an American, my first amendment right to freedom of speech, opinion, religion and assembly is protected by the constitution. This app is in utter violation of those constitutional rights as they censor anyone who strays from the narrative. Before you go saying oh I‚Äôm a ‚Äútrumpie‚Äù or something, let it be known I am neither a Democrat or a Republican, I am an American citizen and I hate Biden and Trump. I will not conform to the PC rules of today, and if I get censored for having a difference of opinion that it utter nonsense. Not all Democrats are good and not all Republicans are bad. If you want the division in our country to end you must first allow those on opposing sides to come together with a common goal. Censoring one side will not help in that, it will only delay us coming back together. So please consider that Twitter!"
"Update: Twitter keeps suspending our accounts, and is requiring a separate mobile phone for each account. This makes it very hard for someone to spam Twitter (which is good), but makes it harder for those businesses such as oGoing who want local presence in various metros. You can‚Äôt be expected to have several mobile phone numbers... Further a suspended account breaks your brand. I have informed Twitter Support several times about this but they don‚Äôt seem to offer a good solution. 

- ‚ÄúWhat You May Have Missed‚Äù keeps you engaged with important stories 
- Trends are becoming more and more relevant 
- Moments are super fun and quick to read 
- Posting and sharing is always easy

About the only thing that still needs work is real engagement from followers. If you don‚Äôt have a huge following, say of at least 20,000 real users or more, engagement is hard to obtain! This could become the eventual Achille‚Äôs Heel... 

I also like the fact that Twitter is removing many fake or inactive users. This actually lowered my Followers by around 30%. That kind of hurts, but it totally makes sense.

One thing for sure: It‚Äôs an app that one can‚Äôt seem to stop using!"
"This site used to be one of my favorites. Then it decided it was going to censor to the president of the United States Of America. The leader of the free world. Any company who does this is obviously against having a free world. This is seen by banning president Trump and many other conservatives for preventive measures for inciting further violence. Yet they still have the account of the Supreme Leader Of Iran up and functioning where in his account he tweeted ‚Äúrevenge for the people for ordered the murder of  General Soleimani‚Äù which is a threat against the president of the United States Of America which in turn is a threat against the United States Of America. Why does Twitter not categorize this as ‚Äúinciting violence‚Äù? For this reason I am deleting my Twitter account. Jack said in 2015 in a tweet that Twitter is pro free speech, and if this is true what is with all the ‚Äúdisputed‚Äù marks all over conservative tweets. All political arguments can be considered ‚Äúdisputed‚Äù yet you don‚Äôt see ‚Äúdisputed‚Äù on key democrats in the government such as Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer. I am appalled by this radical behavior and bias."
"However, I have been shadow banned, reply deboosted  and I have been a member for 9 years without any ‚Äútwitter jail‚Äù issues and I have only been able to follow back 5 or so people for the last 6-7 months, prior to that may 5 a week? People who are crude, rude and nasty and they are newer to twitter have way more followers than I do... and if someone follows me, I can‚Äôt follow them back , so they unfollow me.

I have sent tweets to twitter support multiple times, but never hear anything back.   I‚Äôm a single mother and also m caring for my elderly mother and young Daughter, I feel like the my only joy of using twitter is being censored and if I knew why I would fix it in a second.  Can some help me.    Thanks in advance ... Lori (geekgirl_tweets)"
"As a 60 year old near senior I have seen a lot of life I have never seen a clear path of public opinion unobstructed even though Twitter claims they‚Äôre unbiased the censoring says otherwise . There‚Äôs a fine line between laying guidelines and censorship I have enjoyed the app just the same for what it‚Äôs worth but I am by no means a armchair quarterback I am a realist I expect twitter to respect the public whether they agree with it or not feel it‚Äôs false or not and his is not a news platform this is public forum for the public all walks to speak what they believe or perceive things to be even if it‚Äôs wrong or incorrect it is to be read by those who care to read and to decide and
Fact check themselves by replies and their own sources the removal of tweets through censoring seems contrary to what the people
Perceive twitter to be about public input . Dr. Mario Mazz"
"Twitter has been violating the first amendment rights & freedom of press for every conservative account. Big tech has infiltrated and silenced the truth about Covid-19 and has blocked accounts that worked tirelessly to exposed the sham and attack on America's liberties. 

Furthermore, this platform has perpetuated the fake news of the far left while demonizing anything and everything that this country has accomplished over centuries. I am embarrassed to remotely use this service, but Unfortunately this is a work tool for me. I hope for the day that our elected officials take severe actions to bring down tyrants such as Jack Dorsey and his left wing degenerates controlling and limiting what, when & how content gets distributed. Breakup big tech and give the people the power to sue companies that shamelessly violates freedom and liberty in the ""last free country standing"". This is pretty ironic to even say at this day and age with the censorship of an entire country that voted for the opposed party or simply disagrees with BLM/Antifa Marxist ideology."
"After testifying at a grand jury hearing against a member of the proud boys who attacked me, other members decided to attack my social media, harass me, and dox me. Twitter suspended my account over multiple reported tweets from years ago that were quotes from British comedians that included the word c*nt. Not attacking anyone, just a quote. After being banned, those sending me death threats and spreading my personal information were free to do so without recourse. I have had people show up at my home to threaten me. I‚Äôve had my photo spread to violent extremists all over the nation. I have no recourse, cause Twitter has no option to contact them once you‚Äôre deplatformed. 

I have no problem with them choosing who can use their services, and if my tweets from years ago violated their terms, I don‚Äôt know why I wasn‚Äôt removed then. But that‚Äôs not what happened. I was attacked and they assisted my attackers. and now they allow them to continue attacking me without recourse and without protection."
"Their lack of  tolerance, inclusion, and their in -your-face anti-amendment 1 agenda  is intolerable... I‚Äôm looking to learn new ideas and challenge my beliefs to widen my perspective on various topics to find MY truth . The fact that this site belittles it‚Äôs users by deciding what‚Äôs  ‚Äúsafe‚Äù for us to read is evidence they are only interested in telling us what to think. By limiting the content submissions we can be exposed to based on their personal views of what‚Äôs acceptable, this site is attempting to manipulate its users by telling them what they should be thinking rather  allowing individuals to learn and assess information and others view points for themselves. Because this site is so blatantly willing to do this with the topic of politics they are certainly doing this with all topics of interest.   It‚Äôs extremely disappointing. I‚Äôm exploring other options for more open content and dialogue .I‚Äôm looking for a ites this founder and his tech buddies can‚Äôt shut down/cancel due to a difference of opinion."
"8/31 Update: I am FINALLY able to see retweets with comments. 

Update: No update this app has made has fixed my problem. I literally have to redownload the app if I want to see the retweets with comments section. I get to see it for about two tweets or for about 3 minutes and then the feature disappears. Every single time. WHO CAN I TALK TO TO FIX THIS?!? BRO HELP ME. Twitter devs, I just want to see retweets with comments, I can‚Äôt be the only person with this problem. 

ORIGINAL POST:
I saw twitter announce they were introducing a feature that allowed you to see comments on retweets when you click ‚Äúretweets‚Äù under a tweet. For whatever reason, this new feature was not appearing when I click ‚Äúretweets‚Äù. After weeks of not having this feature, I deleted the app and redownloaded it.  This seemingly fixed the issue and I was able to see retweets with comments. 

However, after a few minutes, the ability to see retweets with comments went away! Now when I click on retweets, it ONLY shows me ‚ÄúRetweeted by‚Äù, not retweets with comments. There‚Äôs no longer a tab to see the comments. 

TL;DL: There‚Äôs a bug that‚Äôs preventing me from seeing retweets with comments."
"I don‚Äôt like repression, being held down by people who are more powerful than me. I don‚Äôt like it when they have something nice and I like to play with it but then they use it against me. They‚Äôll take it away from me because I don‚Äôt play how they like to play. Or keep from bring active for accidentally breaking a rule. My ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù cost my voice, but I must be heard because words are important. Free people should be free to speak so we can decide if they are worthy of be heard or no. One day there maybe no one to listen to because everyone worth hearing has broken the law and has been silenced.  The ones that can be heard still have also broken the same laws I have broken, however, the people work for the service provider or they are friends with the service provider so they receive higher regard and are not susceptible to the same punishments I am at my lower valued station in this arrangement. How much more wealth does a Twitter employee gain by silencing their fellow Americans?"
"Twitter is such an immersive app, whether you have a good or bad experience on the app, you can‚Äôt help but become a part of the experience. I definitely love this app, the global blog aspect that it has, keeps you coming back. Twitter is also a place where you can find news, social communities, and even follow( and sometimes even interact with) your favorite celebrities. The good aspects of Twitter heavily outweigh the bad; in my opinion. But on it‚Äôs bad days, Twitter can become very toxic. Opinions on this app can sometimes be misconstrued as fact, so when operating this app, be sure to have your facts together. Other than that, the app can sometimes become home, the level of immersion is unmatched by any other app; combining the great aspects of most of the other great social media apps around."
"There‚Äôs nothing better than having a reference for anything and everything. You can search for anything and you‚Äôll find it and get in depth analysis on the topic of your choice. You get a really good analysis from the average person to experts and everything in between. Block negative accounts, and there‚Äôs a lot and you‚Äôll enjoy your experience on Twitter. It‚Äôs really easy to get into arguments because some people really know how to push buttons but just remember this; you don‚Äôt know them and you don‚Äôt have to prove anything to them. Don‚Äôt try to change their mind on their stance because you‚Äôre only wasting your time. Twitter teaches you to accept people for who they are and not who you want them to be."
"A young memphis entertainer convinced me to use the app as I was brand new in Public Relations. At first I followed Wendy Williams and felt spammed.  Then I my choice magazines, and some celebrities and expand to ppl who tweeted topics of interest and discovered it to be great national and international news source. It was confirmed when the Bin Laden assassination was first found out via Twitter.  The local weather reporters across the USA or my favorite reporters because I took up truck driving. They can be quite ‚Äúwitty‚Äù.  I‚Äôm well please that everyday citizens can use Twitter as a platform to speak their opinions and possibly be heard by 100‚Äôs, 1000‚Äôs, Millions or even time compiling billions . One thing is needed- an edit button if only just to correct one typo:)"
"as much as people keep on saying this, DO NOT ADD AN EDIT FEATURE. it‚Äôll literally remove the definition of what is a tweet. what is a tweet if you can edit it whenever you‚Äôd like? i could tweet so much horrible stuff and edit it like i never said anything. so many tweets from years ago would be tweaked and NOT in the good way. this could go bad in SO many ways. unnecessary ways. please note other people will not just use the edit feature to just correct an misspelled word. twitter would destory its known for if you could just edit your tweets as much as you‚Äôd like. just DELETE THE TWEET AND ADJUST YOUR MISTAKES. no tweet is that precious that you can‚Äôt just make another one. an edit button is sincerely not needed. literally. people may not agree, but not everyone is SMART. thanks for listening to my ted talk ‚úîÔ∏è"
"I hope trump leaks out all this evidence of Twitter being manipulated by other foreign countries for money, imagine if you were to put all this time and effort into making your own civilization that you were born in; better than we were the day before. Jack is scum and who ever works for him falls into that category as well. Twitter was an American funded application and to see Iranian leaders wish death upon us on this app just shows how bought out you are. God only shows the light and I pray that justice comes soon because you guys deserve nothing but forgiveness for being so corrupt. Doubt this will ever ever ever get read but even if it does, who ever is reading this just know you‚Äôre affecting millions of human beings economically, mentally (brainwash); and physically (riots). Terrible app and it‚Äôs a shame I have to get my filtered news from such a communist app. I pray trump declassifies everything and rips you guys to shreds so that someone else with common sense and good morals can make something better."
"Dear Twitter, it‚Äôs come to my complain that horror and inappropriate fancams are spreading around this certain app. Many of these people have slits in there usernames with a symbol meaning execution. These videos include Killing, people hurting themselves aka self harm, suicide,abuse,and pornagraphy. Can you please solve this by putting in ur concern and permanently banning the accounts and making sure to check over what people are about to post before posting it, way too many people have seen it and has nightmares every night or probably having to take therapy to recover. Asa mother of 3 and grandmother of 1 I hate to let my children going on a normal social media platform and seeing a K-POP fan cam with inappropriate behavior at the end of it when it just looks like a friendly video about their idol dancing to a song.
Thank you for reading and please make sure to notify me when it‚Äôs all over."
"So before this recent update of the Twitter app for iOS, everything was working fine. Dictation was one of those things. Now, it seems that if you are visually impaired or not, you have to write out what you want to say unless you can do short hand. Even if I turn voiceover off, dictation still doesn‚Äôt work. I start to dictate what I want to say and then dictation turns itself off. I have called Apple about this issue, and Apple says that it‚Äôs not their issue. Which in fairness it‚Äôs not. Because dictation works everywhere else. I have even uninstalled the application, turned off the phone, turned on the phone again, and then went to re-download the app. I even signed in with my credentials and tried to dictate a test tweet. That didn‚Äôt work. Please fix this annoying bug for those who have visual impairments or different handicapped problems and also for those who have no visual issues whatsoever. I can‚Äôt even send support help questions because they do not get back to me."
"I would like to be able to search through my followers by name to easily filter through as well as search on other people‚Äôs pages through their followers too. For business/giveaway purposes it makes things so much easier! Another BIG thing that is a safety issue....I absolutely hate when you block someone and that person tries to search for you and your profile still pops up but the page says ‚Äúthis person has blocked you‚Äù. I don‚Äôt want them seeing that I‚Äôve blocked them due to safety reasons. Better that my name doesn‚Äôt pop up at all when they try to search for me after being blocked. 

Other than that this is a great app/platform and great way to reach out to people. I‚Äôve started a new career and met amazing people because of this app. Thank you for changing my life, Twitter."
"I whole heartily Believe that most of Twitter is only used to be negative to others to feed in to other people‚Äôs negative thoughts I also think Twitter is used to spread fake news (obviously not all the time). It is a platform to promote violence, hate, and spread the feeling of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm better than you‚Äù. Also there are not a lot of people supporting each other or helping one another. The amount of people who force their ideas or beliefs down peoples throats are astonishing. What happen to freedom of an opinion or freedom of speech or the pursuit of happiness. 

Share what you want but don‚Äôt bully people because they don‚Äôt see things the same way as you. And for god sake if you don‚Äôt like someone or don‚Äôt like see something do not feed in to it, BLOCK THEM OR REPORT IT if absolutely necessary. Please think about how will this app actually help your mental health. If you like then sure knock your self out I won‚Äôt stop you because it‚Äôs what you believe and I can‚Äôt say otherwise."
"I had finally gotten the Twitter app after years of not having it and hours after I downloaded and started my account I am locked out. I thought reasonably and decided that it must have been for security purposes. I go to start the steps to get back into my account and all that pops up is a plain white screen with the words ‚ÄúAre you a robot?‚Äù writer at the top. There are no arrows no next buttons just these words and a blank screen. I have tried restarting my phone, nothing happened. I have tired to re-download the app, nothing happened. This is especially frustrating because I had just started this account and therefore do not understand the root of my problem. I am wondering if this is a glitch or something else that is not my fault."
"After reading a recent article, about Twitters Chief Designer being African American-Korean it made me rather happy. The change that reflects the users perspective is starting to show while scouring through Twitters app. I noticed the new updates that have been taking place on the platform. Diversity within a company like Twitter can send a massive change for other tech companies to do the same to ‚Äúinclude don't dilute‚Äù. Also for you to able to monetize your account, it says to change your bio, after doing so, I still cannot update my account to a Super Fan Monetization. Can you all try to fix the glitch. I meet the requirements to monetize my account the issue is the bio update that has failed me to do so."
"Update: I‚Äôve always loved this app. Now. Few things....I want the profile button back at the bottom. I want access to my profile page as well as my lists with one hit of the button not five. Second. Trending. I don‚Äôt want things in my trending to be completely local. Or completely national. Why? Bc it‚Äôs not always relevant. A few tweets about something local... is neither trending news nor unusual...we know there's a hawks game....okay? Nor (I guess third and lastly) do I want meaningless fluff. Like moments of celebs. That‚Äôs not news either.

First review: I'd like better filtering especially for all political words please ;) Also a big deal for me...is the hoops I‚Äôve got to jump through just to get back to my profile. It‚Äôs my most used key. I‚Äôd like it back on the bottom dashboard. It‚Äôs ridiculous that it is so many back pages away to get to my main page. Definitely impedes my experience."
"It‚Äôs a great app you do what you do and it‚Äôs consistent but then whenever I get a bug it changes everything! Like whenever I tweet or try to reply to something it crashes on me, and I‚Äôm having a problem right now, so the people I accounts that I have notifications turned on for aren‚Äôt going to my notifications, I can see that they post and it‚Äôll pop up on my phone screen but when I click the notifications on twitter it won‚Äôt show up at all!! It‚Äôs bugging me considering I can‚Äôt see the post I have to find it. The only thing that I see for my notifications is people who reply to me and recommendation/trends . Besides this big bug the app is really good and it‚Äôs something I use daily to keep up with everything."
"I know this is a bit late but I think it has to be said again that it was a mistake to remove the option to view worldwide trends. The internet is supposed to bring the world together not segment it into many different boxes. Maybe I‚Äôm just too stupid to figure out a setting that will fix this and I‚Äôm barking up the wrong tree. I do hope that‚Äôs the case, but if that‚Äôs not it I just fail to understand why this decision was made. The only people that benefit from that are the ones that want to restrict the flow of information in and out of a country or territory. I‚Äôm not saying that these trends can‚Äôt be manipulated by bad-faith actors because they can and have, I‚Äôm sure. Just saying that the drawbacks of not being able to see legitimate trends outweighs the pros of not seeing any (legit or not) at all. I know a review realistically won‚Äôt do anything but maybe by telling  people that this app isn‚Äôt what it was they can find an alternative."
"This app is the cumulative waste pile of the internet. I have never seen a more biased and disingenuous approach to the way the guidelines and TOS are used (or abused rather). They have protected groups of people who are allowed to dox, threaten (including death threats), bully, and abuse in all manners, people who dissent from their narratives. Forget about civil discourse. If you even ask a question pertaining to the validity of their narratives, or the way in which guidelines are enforced, you will be banned, censored, and abused in all the fore-mentioned ways. Even if you present valid and comprehensive proof of these things happening, you will either be suspended, or at a bare minimum, have a warning attached to your tweet stating that it‚Äôs not true, and not allowing that tweet to be re-tweeted or shared in any capacity. I hope that people realize the depth of which this app has tried to manipulate them and their civil liberties, and find other ways to engage in social media. Twitter is the butthole of the internet in which the BS flows."
There is nothing else quite like Twitter. It‚Äôs really fun to be on Twitter. I just hope the censorship will be confined and limited. Freedom of speech is one of our basic rights and some administrative employees of Twitter are too quick to censure people for speaking freely. That could cause a major lawsuit and could ruin twitter. I hope that the management at twitter will be smart enough to control their employees and prevent illegal censoring and allow all people to speak freely on twitter  because that‚Äôs one of the best things about twitter. There is no place else where ordinary citizens can tweet with high ranking government officials and say what we think about things. Twitter is the only way we can do this therefore I certainly hope that Twitter management will reign in some of their overzealous employees and allow total freedom of speech on Twitter.
"I‚Äôm sure all phones have this option, to open a tweet up from your notification on your lock screen! Well when I tap to open a specific tweet on one of my top followers, it doesn‚Äôt open to their tweet, but to my account messages! And then I have to go search their name and scroll through ‚Äútweets and likes‚Äù until I find the tweet, and most of the time they tweeted again by this time! I‚Äôve tried every setting, I tried not closing out Twitter. Once in a while it works but mostly not! Also another highly frustrating problem is I only have notifications for all tweets turned on for maybe 5 people, but I do not get these notifications for some reason and these are very important to me!! Any ideas, anyone?"
"I like Twitter for the people on the platform and as a source for curated content. .The app, while functional, is confusing. A lot of this boils down to the UX.  The ux elements are crammed together - perhaps to show more rows of content. The end result is it‚Äôs not clear where to tap to do actions vs view them. For e.g, It‚Äôs not clear where to tap to view replies vs enter a reply.  Same with Likes.  Fb does a much better job of this by having separation in the ux for these two.  Finally, with posts with links - why not show a preview? Right now I don‚Äôt know what the link contains or if it send me to some malicious site.  Finally it‚Äôs not clear how to view topics by interests. Also for advanced features like moments, and lists - I have no idea what they are for and how to use them - make it clear. Getting these basics right will go a long way in making the site more useful for non power users."
"Twitter has become my full time job explaining my view of the world. The Trump election got me started and I am still going strong. Back in the day when the telephone was the communication way we had ‚Äúparty lines‚Äù where a couple of people could talk to each other at the same time. And that was it! And you had to be close to each other anyway it was the only ‚Äúgame‚Äù in town. Now Twitter can reach around the world instantaneously!  People can communicate with people post notifications, announce events, gossip, share information. News outlets can break news reports when ever they want. And having your own personal Twitter account is so necessary in these times. Twitter is all I use because it‚Äôs all I need."
"I have had the app for 7.5 years and never had one problem. Sure, it would crash from time to time, but, overall, it has been great. The reason I don‚Äôt like it contain the following; About 3 years ago I bought a 6 person tent. It was $250 Ozark Trails, and it said it would arrive in 6 business days. 3 weeks later, I‚Äôm still waiting, and 3 weeks turned to 3 months, which eventually turned to 3 years. Tent arrive? Not at all. Money back? Not a cent. And then, about 2 weeks ago it locked me out of my account saying, ‚ÄúPlease sign in with the original e-mail and phone number. NEWS FLASH I got a new phone number and e-mail. What a shocker. I tried the password for my E-mail, but of course I forgot it. It than proceeded to tell me to do the security questions I had set up, but of course that didn‚Äôt work, and now I‚Äôm furious. Please help me, someone. Their customer service is terrible."
"Being an immigrant to this country I thought I escaped the dictatorship communist country - a governing that censored what WE SAW, who wrote what, who thought what to propel the propaganda and narrative they WANTED us to have. What a disgrace this company has a the power to SILENCE and pick and choose WHO, while Iran and the communist Chinese party continues its dangerous disgusting tweets of terror against our country - you banned a sitting president of the United States. If it was so easy to take down different services why is it so hard to shut down child porn web servers? 

This is a shame and a disgrace. This doesn‚Äôt end here it‚Äôs only the beginning. Deleting my Twitter was the best thing I ever could do. And if you disagree you are a hypocrite that‚Äôs been fed lies and brainwashed - until you‚Äôve lived in a country that stripped your voice to only let the voice THEY want you to hear - then you will never understand how this is a dangerous path. I never thought I‚Äôd see America follow this path."
"I never was much of a fan of Twitter. But to silence the President of the United States while allowing so many actual terrorists to keep their accounts is unbelievable. For those that think this a good thing I can‚Äôt help but wonder, are you really that asleep? The country as we know it is shifting down a scary path. It‚Äôs heartbreaking and sadly it‚Äôs because we fed these ‚Äúbig tech‚Äù company‚Äôs our money and now they decide what is truth and what isn‚Äôt. I did all I can do, I review bombed Twitter because they aren‚Äôt about Americans or the values that make us such a great country. Yet they somehow infiltrated the US and now have more power than the United States President. Will it make a difference, no. Was it a waste of time, probably. Will the App Store sensor it so that no one even sees it, most likely. Will my accounts be deactivated because I don‚Äôt align with the ‚Äúwoke‚Äù left.... not yet (I hope), but sooner than I would probably expect. My oh my how 4 years can change a lot. Politics sure are ugly."
"Twitter is now complacent with censoring all differing outlooks and thoughts that are not main stream i.e. liberal. It‚Äôs really a shame because it used to be a much more open, fun platform to have civil debates with people‚Äîincluding parody accounts where people would have a fun laugh at themselves when they fall for a parody of a famous person. As a society we have become way too serious we have moved away from jokes and lighthearted fun and exchanged it for constant worry about everything that everyone says. People don‚Äôt have senses of humor any longer and it‚Äôs really sad. People have even sued the president of United States because they were blocked by him. With a ruling like that where the blocked people needed to be unblocked, you would think that Twitter shouldn‚Äôt suspend anyone from their platform... but they have. I am positive that Twitter has lost millions of users...because you‚Äôve lost me and everyone else that I know that was on here before. I sincerely hope this platform dies an agonizing death."
"I am disappointed that I was one of your first Twitter members, I‚Äôm disappointed that I worked seven years at building 5000+ followers and having under 900 following. I‚Äôm disappointed that when I needed your help to recover my original at coachcolombi account Twitter would not so much as acknowledge me outside of a computer generated reply. My situation you do not cover in your helpdesk is not one of steps you have. You do not care I‚Äôve reached out to you. I‚Äôm disappointed that I had to start a brand new account, the brand new account which has no followers and my followers were all college coaches NFL scouts I help high school athletes achieve college scholarships and not having my Twitter account anymore is hurting hundreds of young hard-working athletes in South Florida. You have no idea how it feels to be abandoned by a social media App as yourself that I have spoken so highly of that I put all my faith in God I believe in. But your back was turned on me. All I asked is for your help."
The only thing I don‚Äôt appreciate with Twitter is dropping people in on me that I don‚Äôt want to listen to some of my opinion Twitter followers have been removed and others have replaced them that I didn‚Äôt choose?  I don‚Äôt want their nonsense and I didn‚Äôt choose it that bothers me I get enough of that in the doctors office and everything when they carry CNN Who refuses to give facts and gives only opinions craziness.  I just want facts not someone‚Äôs opinion and I‚Äôm not stupid I can make up my own mind listening to facts only.  I‚Äôve heard of the social media‚Äôs getting rid of the common sense thinkers and posting more of the far out thinking which is stupidity I hope Twitter does not do this. I thought I saw some evidence of it not too long ago so I hope it‚Äôs not true please stop it.
"Overall Twitter is a great idea. 
It puts public dialogue out there.
It advances news that normally gets lost in commercial breaks on network newscasts. It allows the average person to see breaking stories and state their opinions in real time. 
It‚Äôs got all the hallmarks of being greatest public forum ever. 
But, it seems to lean toward choosing who and what gets to say and be said too much. 
Civility and public safety are not the same as creating a ‚Äúsafe space‚Äù where not getting you feelings hurt or seeing opinions that differ from yours are the obvious goal. 
Sometimes we all need, and should get, a good dose of the truth. 
It seems that from politicians to the mainstream media that everyone has an agenda already in mind. 
What drew me and multi millions of people to Twitter in the first place was that it was a clean slate. 
A place where you could see the raw, unvarnished truth. 
Agree or disagree with it in a public forum without someone trying to slant things one way or another. 
Be it liberal or conservative we all need a break sometimes from prepared news. 
We need to see the real news and how it affects others out there without a talking head interpretation. 
Twitter was that vehicle. 
Was. 
I‚Äôm not so sure anymore."
"Twitter is a great app for looking at news and things in the moment. But sometimes you want to save things for later. 

Even though you can bookmark Tweets, that‚Äôs pretty much there is to it. Just a cluttered long list of bookmarked Tweets. Trying to find a specific Tweet can be very difficult in this situation.  

It would be easier to get through bookmarked Tweets by being able to make folders or categories for different groups of Tweets. There could be a selection feature that would be able to copy or move multiple Tweets to another folder or category. Even though these suggestions seem unimportant, they can make a world of a difference if they‚Äôre implemented."
"The push notification feature has become unbearable. I am a heavy user and I have meticulously maintained what I want to be notified for by Twitter.

Over the years, every time there is a new feature, this app quietly adds a new push notification option and it‚Äôs of course default on. Fine. I have to go check every now and then and turn them off myself. I‚Äôm not happy about it, but it‚Äôs manageable.

I do like the retweet/reply notifications to stay engaged with my conversations. There are only two options there, be notified for interactions from ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù or ‚Ä¶‚Äùtailored for you‚Äù. I miss the ‚Äúonly people you follow‚Äù dearly. Recently the app has been trying harder and harder to get me pay attention to someone I don‚Äôt care about. It is exhausting. After four notification in ten minutes about some random schmuck who liked my tweet, I decided that Twitter was plainly harassing me. I have turned off all push notifications now. 

Social networks can be toxic and soul crushing. It is vital for my own mental health that I have full control of what I see. I get it, it‚Äôs not aligned with the company‚Äôs business goals.

I had the same issue (unstoppable unwanted notifications) with Facebook and I stopped using it. That was three years ago. Maybe it‚Äôs time for me to move on from this one too."

"I somewhat like Twitter. It has its good and it‚Äôs bad. It serves as a source of news, entertainment and in general a place where you can get the opinions and feelings of tweeters. It‚Äôs a quick and easy way to reach thousands of people or follow trends however, Twitter can be addictive. On the ugly side, Twitter is like the devils playground.  It‚Äôs a deceitful TRAP that can slowly pull you into a place of ugliness and evil. Twitter brings out the WORST in most tweeters and if you‚Äôre not careful, you can easily get caught up in blasting, cussing and defaming people. Satan lives on Twitter. 

However, as Christians we need to let our voice be heard on Twitter and other social media play. We need to spread the love of Jesus Christ, His forgiveness and hope, grace and mercy that can only be had through Christ. Let‚Äôs spread love on Twitter, not hate."
"Out of the blue twitter decided to suspend my account for violation of rules. I immediately tried to appeal it and figure out why. All they responded with was that i broke a rule. Ok cool, tried asking for what tweet or what i said that would‚Äôve made that happen, they refused to tell me. There is NO way of contacting them directly besides dming them on twitter. It‚Äôs kind of impossible to DM someone on twitter when your account is suspended. I‚Äôve emailed them multiple times and they have yet to respond. I love twitter a lot, but this is just ridiculous. i tried making a new account solely just to ask them what was going on, the second i made it, it got suspended. They have no reps to talk to, and they have no reason for deleting my account. i‚Äôm very upset and won‚Äôt stop trying until i get an answer. Honestly, save your time and don‚Äôt download lol."
"I have been a member of Twitter since 2011? I deactivated it because at that time, I couldn‚Äôt juggle m time being so busy with every thing. Until I moved here in America in late 2014, I joined a Glee singing app that's based in the heart of San Francisco. Having been part of #SMULE, it has given me strong motivation to pursue the dream that have become so pending due to unavoidable circumstances like health issues ... connecting it to Twitter, I believe and I‚Äôve realized how beneficial this is for persons that‚Äôs currently starting to create her own set of avenues towards a success in singing. Music has been part of my life, without this, I don‚Äôt think you can still see me here. Thanks to technology and gracious blessings to #TWITTER, another awesome social media app."
"This social network plaform is serving a great need to connect people all over the world allowing them to express their opinions to the public and each other. My biggest complaint is shadow banning people and stopping them from being part of the show. Once shadow banned,I felt a deep sense of concern about censorship and a feeling of helplessness no longer being able to post my opinions to twitter. As a conservative Im worried about liberals at twitter trying to slant the narrative by censoring conservative speakers and puttin algorithms on them to silence their free speech or shove them to the bottom of the list where they are unlikely to be seen. I see a lot of nasty tweets that should not be allowed esp. under president Trumps twitter account,people using vile gestures or the f-word. There should be no censorship on clean decent honest criticizm on either side liberal or conservative this is true freedom and would make twitter a great platform for the world."
"As a ‚Äúproduct‚Äù of Twitter‚Äôs, We the People should be able to disagree with each other, as well as our government. How else would they sell our information in an accurate and efficient way? Advertisers (who are the actual ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù of these platforms) should demand uncensored information about the products they are purchasing. 
Apparently they only value the opinions of those willing to comply with the ideals that the mainstream media commands. If you enjoy seeing the worst in humanity, by all means, this platform is for you. If you value free speech, and freedom of thought.....this may not be for you.  This review will probably be banned, or mysteriously lost in the shuffle.....big tech loves the control of being able to erase people. It‚Äôs just the beginning folks, eventually they run out of Republicans to harass, and will move on to you, and whatever label you‚Äôve been assigned. May God bless our Republic."
"After only a week on Twitter, my account was suspended for alleged violations of my user agreement. Since there was no mention of violence, racism, threats, vulgarity, or anything of the kind, I was perplexed. I did use the term ‚Äúthreatening‚Äù in my tweet, because I was actually calling out a particular journalist for his engaging in actions that were threatening. I was condemning threatening behavior, not condoning it. Twitter suspended my account, probably because my tweet questioned a well known, most certainly left-leaning figure. I promptly appealed, and waited 2 weeks without receiving a response. I appealed again, waited several more days, and never received a response. I finally gave up & deleted the tweet that should never have been in question only so I could resume access. Twitter suppresses conservative viewpoints and acts as a publisher in violation of its Section 230 protections. It must be held accountable. I have since opened an account at Parler & strongly encourage anyone who believes in free speech to do likewise."
"I‚Äôm at the point where I‚Äôm about to disable notifications on the system level for Twitter. I really don‚Äôt want to do that, because I‚Äôd miss replies/mentions/DMs/etc from my friends and family ‚Äî but notifications are out of control and the in-app settings don‚Äôt seem to do anything.

Today, for example, I woke up to a ‚Äú6‚Äù badge on my Twitter app. I open it, and what do I see? Six ‚Äúsuggested tweets‚Äù from brand accounts and people I rarely talk to. I did the same thing I always do: tap ‚Äúsee less often‚Äù on every single one. But guess what? That doesn‚Äôt actually do anything. They keep coming without fail.

Notification settings don‚Äôt fix this, either. I‚Äôve turned off EVERYTHING except emergency alerts and replies/mentions/DMs from accounts I follow. Even with those settings, I still get these notifications about random tweets I don‚Äôt actually care about.

Twitter: let me turn this off, or I‚Äôll turn all notifications off and that‚Äôll likely lead to me eventually deleting your app. It‚Äôs seriously annoying, and terrible UX. Also, you have the nerve to ask me to pay for ‚ÄúTwitter Blue‚Äù when your app is pestering me with useless notifications I can‚Äôt turn off? Now that‚Äôs just insulting. Fix your app‚Äôs notifications, please."
"I can no longer move/reorder accounts, like I could, yesterday. Plus, there are huge lags, on some accounts. Yes, this is after uninstalling/installing, and then turning my phone off and back on. Is there any beta testing, before new versions are rolled out? It shouldn't be infested with bugs, and lag. Go back to one week ago, please, to version 7.7 or 7.8. Seriously, the last bad update we had, I used to go back to version 6.31.5 (courtesy of downloading it from my Mac), and it was a huge improvement in functionality, despite the giant step backward. It was worth it. Now I can‚Äôt even do that anymore, thanks to the bloody update on my Mac! Also, scrolling back to the top of a thread is a hugely bad idea. If you want to make it so we can toggle between seeing the first tweet or the last, great. Give us the option. 

***
Older review (though still applicable): 

Revert the app to one week ago, and don't touch it. Now, it lags, has fits and coughs, and quits... It's such a pain. I hate guinea-pigging updates. We shouldn't have to delete and reinstall to reset the app for better functionality. 

I chain tweets together, and it's aggravating to be typing along...and have a lag. My fingers keep moving in the hopes that the app will catch up. It does, seconds later, when I should be already on my next tweet."
Worst social media app out there! Completely controlled by liberal terrorists! Constant attempts to bias people by suppressing any real news stories out there. It actually encourages the sharing of fake news stories like the Rittenhouse story or hunter bidens laptop and illegal gun. They intentionally portray information in a false light as they have no accountability whatsoever. This promotes actual terrorism due to the fact they intentionally lie to their users creating animosity when there truly shouldn‚Äôt be any. Constantly banning posts that don‚Äôt support their radical leftists views like the factual news stories I mentioned above are either ignored completely (not able to post at all) or fictionalized as they did with the hunters laptop then there is the whole china lab leak story‚Ä¶ the examples are endless and in the end we‚Äôve all seen that the actual evidence shows that the twitter nazi‚Äôs were wrong and intentionally suppressed or simply fabricated false information otherwise known as propaganda.
"What if we did not have an instrument like Twitter, would we speak through Facebook? No! The most narrow minded people populate the FB family. We can take our opinions to Twitter without fear of retribution.  
Right now, women‚Äôs rights concerning their bodies are being challenged in the states that are primarily Republican.  Their aim is to overturn Roe v Wade!  Do we as a nation, want to get rid of a law that has saved thousands of women‚Äôs lives? Does no one remember what butchery went on during the time frame prior to 1973? Does any of the old white guys remember that the Supreme Court ruled that the due process law of the 14th amendment of the U S Constitution, provides a fundamental ‚Äúright to privacy‚Äùthat protects a pregnant woman‚Äôs liberty to choose whether or not to have an abortion!  If this ‚ÄúLaw‚Äù is ignored, what other laws are going to be changed?"
"I‚Äôve been using Twitter for years and it‚Äôs just getting worse. I made a mean tweet once and they suspended my account and then proceeded to suspend every other account I made after that, even with zero connections to the first suspended ones. I‚Äôm not a toxic user at all, the bad tweet was a one time thing but now all they do is constantly target me (and other innocent accounts). They love locking your account but keeping it visible to others so your friends won‚Äôt even know you don‚Äôt have access to your account. I don‚Äôt think Twitter genuinely listens to your emails or complaints, I‚Äôve told them I can‚Äôt unlock my accounts with a phone number because I don‚Äôt have one but they keep telling me the same thing. A lot of people don‚Äôt have a phone number and used our emails to make the account. They also love to suspend your accounts for dumb reasons or without giving a clear reason why they did it. I hope this app dies like Facebook did."
"I really used to like this app, but recent changes have made it nearly unusable. My biggest complaint is the change in notifications. Previously they came across the bottom of the screen and now they are at the top which isn't as handy. Before, if I opened an article to read or a video clip, the notifications would be held until I closed the article /video which meant I could read or watch w/out interruptions or missing anything. It also used to hold notifications while I was writing a tweet, but now they just keep coming which makes me miss a lot of them, or I constantly go back and forth between the article and new notifications. 
Tweets also appear cut off at times so I can't always see the very top of a tweet or even hit the like button because it's outside of the area I can touch. I thought these were bugs that would be corrected, but they haven't been."
"Social media (Twitter is one exceptional example) is somehow under the impression that the American people cannot form their own opinions or be held responsible as an individual. There is an overwhelming amount of censorship against ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù or what anyone considers ‚Äúfake news‚Äù taking place at Twitter. This has obviously spiraled out of control as Twitter is now, along with FB and the Alphabet gang, constantly targeted by law makers and even the hypocritical media outlets. Although the world is not a safe place and you want to inspire the opposite, don‚Äôt force your ideas on the individual. In other words, stop manipulating the platforms we use to spread your own ideology and impression. Understanding that Twitter is global, you are undoubtedly pressured by foreign societies to enact protections specific to their following and culture. America is the opposite in that belief, all the way down to our core. We invite freedom of thought, breeding opportunity and progress. Ill leave you with a quote from an entertainment figure and politician that we all could stand behind (to the contrary of the current equivalent). 

‚ÄúMr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!‚Äù 

Now please, step back and remove your thought policing and anti-anything stance. Let your censorship align with current US FEDERAL law and regulations, nothing more. We need less influence in our lives and more education, more objectivity. 

Real Talk,

"Tried to sign on to Twitter, Couldn‚Äôt remember password. Clicked forgot password, Twitter sent a password reset response to my email. Went to email to bring up the temporary password that I was certain I‚Äôd find within the email from Twitter. It said ‚Äúthe password has already been reset‚Äù. So I went back to the Twitter App,- the App is asking for my password... of course TWITTER DIDN‚ÄôT GIVE ME A TEMPORARY/NEW PASSWORD So THAT I COULD INPUT IT INTO THE PASSWORD FRAME!!!  I even emailed Twitter immediately for help, they sent an auto-response back to me saying ‚Äúthis is an UNMONITORED EMAIL‚Äù so there will be no one at Twitter to address my concern.
So basically,- I‚Äôm SHUTOUT FROM MY TWITTER ACCOUNT just for FORGETTING MY PASSWORD!  After several rounds of this episode of ‚ÄúGroundhog Twitter‚Äù (at least 5-7),
I just gave up! (And I NEVER give up on anything!) I even tried to start a new account, it wouldn‚Äôt let me do that either.
Wasted this whole Saturday morning messing around with Twitter! My time is money! No, I‚Äôm not mad - But I sure am angry! üò°"
"This app is made incredibly well - I never have any issues opening up the app nor and issues using the app. The UI is smooth and never choppy, and the features are constantly being tweaked.

The ONLY real criticism I have for the app is the user base. People go on here and lose jobs. People get on here and go viral for simple mistakes. People will be harassed for the slightest reasons. People have their way of living CHANGED because of this app. Misinformation is out there and flourishing on Twitter, the speed of our communication is immeasurably fast - Twitter capitalizing on this only led us to faster misunderstandings and even faster judgement of others. End this madness and end Twitter. 

But to reiterate, the app is well made for a horrible company."
"I made an account a couple months back, and it was and still is new, and empty. I‚Äôve haven‚Äôt tweeted, followed, or anything. All of a sudden, I try to log in, ‚ÄúYour account is suspended.‚Äù Basically I got banned for NO REASON! This is unacceptable! After that, It says look for a prompt to confirm your email address. So I saw it, I clicked it, but guess what? It didn‚Äôt do anything, despite saying we‚Äôll send you a email. And another thing, I have another account I made. It‚Äôs a bit younger, but I still haven‚Äôt posted anything on it. I log in, ‚ÄúYour account is suspended.‚Äù OH. MY. GOD. So not ONLY did it suspend my first account, it also suspended my SECOND ACCOUNT! Once again, for no reason! I‚Äôll give it two stars because I actually enjoy Twitter. But this is just disappointing and unacceptable. And for the love of tweets, give me a real response for this. Please don‚Äôt just send an automated email that says, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sorry for the inconvenience, and we‚Äôll review your comment and see what we can do.‚Äù Thank you."
"While Twitter usability is good, the censorship of conservative voices and actual news verges on criminal. Twitter openly promotes leftist narratives, squashes and outright censors conservative news and viewpoints by limiting actions (retweets), deleting or capping followers, labeling information as being ‚Äúfact checked‚Äù or ‚Äúnot true‚Äù as determined by their ‚Äúfact checkers‚Äù though the rules are not applied equally across the platform, leftist narratives with no factual basis are allowed to spread like wildfire in CA, but fact-based, damming information about progressives and leftists (like Hunter Biden‚Äôs laptop and evidence of selling access to his father for millions to China, Ukraine, etc) get banned immediately or severe limits put on distribution. CEO Jack Dorsey must believe he has been anointed king bc he clearly believes he has the right to kill the 1st Amendment and control speech. Scary how much he reminds me of the early days of Hitler! If I could give demerits instead of stars, I would award Dorsey billions."
"I believe Twitter is using its power to censor people on their app. I have no idea why they believe they are the authority that can decide what information does or doesn‚Äôt get out. I like Twitter for the jokes and memes, but it‚Äôs a well designed app that allows for people to deliver information to the public, or to share their thoughts or views on something. Taking away people‚Äôs right to an opinion, because you or someone disagrees, is corrupt and evil. If you have an app with rules, that‚Äôs fine, but it‚Äôs clear that the rules are not being applied fairly and that your taking advantage of the power you hold and to us it feels like you‚Äôre taking our appreciation for granted. This I a very dangerous game you‚Äôre playing and I honestly think that some day the tables will turn and your regret turning you back on the people you made a commitment to quote-unquote ‚Äúserve‚Äù. 
P.S.: I forgot this was a review and not a letter to the company, but I hope they see this"
"Twitter is a social media platform but it‚Äôs unlike any other platform ever. With the ability to see what‚Äôs going on instantly, on any topic, anywhere and at anytime, you can see what‚Äôs new in the world but also follow your own hobbies like Tech, Games, Cars etc in a community unlike any other platform where extremely insightful users of Twitter tweet about extremely important things as well as lighthearted and funny things all in one app. If I could explain this app in one sentence, it would be it does everything you need a Social Media app to do. As well as, tweeting yourself is also fun and I myself is coming up on 1,400 followers. Just download it now and you won‚Äôt regret it. -Jason"
"As the title says, I enjoy Twitter as a service. Despite all of ways in which it can be and is abused, it can also be a terrific source of information, news, and learning. 

That said, the app is one of the most frustrating apps I've ever used. It has gotten so bad that I can't even write my own Tweets or replies to others within the app itself (I have to use Notes on my iPhone and copy/paste stuff in), because if I need to stop and Google something or check the spelling of a word in another app, I lose not only everything I had typed, but in the case of replies, the app doesn't even remember the Tweet I was looking at when I go back to it from my web browser (in addition to anything I typed being gone).

All of it ads up to a frustrating experience that has resulted in me interacting with others and using Twitter less."
I like enjoy some of the Twitter accounts I‚Äôm glad that you blocked some of the racist posts and profiles shown on Facebook and Instagram..I know we will have a better future in 2021 thanks to Joe Biden Kamala Harris! Hey maybe if Donald Trump from the beginning followed the doctors and all the whole entire rest of the world in getting behind there being an actual problem with the COVID-19 and then we‚Äôd all be back to school and back to work just like every other country that is closer to China than we are we are on the other side of the planet and we are still dealing with Covid but South Korea and China are showing zero COVID-19 cases but yet we are rising in death toll is still constantly this is ridiculous
"When the opinions don‚Äôt match your ideology- you think you can sit behind a desk and block people. You may have codes and technology hierarchy but you will never be able to shut down and control people‚Äôs hearts. Before you get on your high horse further- look deep inside yourself and see that the real puppet is you. You, likely the intern, or mid twenty trying to get somewhere in your career- year olds were made for more than this. Look deep in your heart and realize that this hatred brewing inside of you will not equate to the life you really want. Break up with the power trying to control you. Let love rule triumphant. Love believes the best and is humble and willing to listen to others- even when they don‚Äôt agree. Don‚Äôt cave to the very thing you hate. You are better than this. Do the right thing. Allow free speech. Allow hearts to be shared. Be brave.  Even if it costs you your job. Your soul is worth more than a promotion."
"The Twitter App runs smooth. No freezing up. Never closes out. In fact, this darn autocorrect is the one that‚Äôs bothersome. But who can I blame for that? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è... EXACTLY! I‚Äôm joining you on an iPhone 7 S + Plus. let‚Äôs talk about my device while we‚Äôre at it. I love this phone! The only reason I had to exchange it was the screen was cracked. This time it‚Äôs in an otter box. So let‚Äôs talk about that too while we‚Äôre at it. I know it doesn‚Äôt make our thousand dollar phones look pretty. But (and this is a crucial but) cracked screens don‚Äôt look so pretty either. I swear by Otter box phone case , iPhone 7S+Plus, And TWITTER! I‚Äôll never trade any of them for all the fame and fortune in the world. They‚Äôre what makes me feel grounded and content. I love you Twitterüòò"
"i love twitter. trust me, i really do. i‚Äôve been on the app since 2014 and it‚Äôs extremely disheartening to see it start to go down hill. the most recent update is just tragic. why would the people of twitter feel the need to create a top tweets page and set it as my HOME PAGE ?? and if you switch it to ‚Äòlatest tweets‚Äù, you can see most retweets which is just absolutely amazing if the people you don‚Äôt want to see anything that the people you actually FOLLOW are retweeting. my home page is crowded with ADS and pointless top and trending tweets that the people i follow didn‚Äôt even retweet. this update is truly making me consider deleting the app. so yeah unless the mess of a home/latest tweets page gets fixed i can‚Äôt give it more than a one star review. if you even asked me a day ago to give a review i would have said 5 stars. it‚Äôs an honest shame that twitter is following the trashy path of other social media platforms by getting rid of a chronological timeline. r.i.p to a good app."
I wish for there to be better and more Flexible notification options and for them to actually work. For example. I wish for there to be a option for there to be to choose what nonfictions like replies or likes that makes the phone make a chime/nonfiction noise or vibrate. This can be useful for people who follow a lot of people on the site and don‚Äôt want their phones to make a nonfiction noise every 2 seconds. I tried to fix this by turning off tweet nonfictions but then it deactivated the retweet and likes option basically making it useless. You were able to do it before but I don‚Äôt know why you reversed but you basically short yourself in the foot by removing that feature. Please give us the option to do this
"There is never a day where twitter does not cease to give me muscle spasmic laughter. The app's ability to unite people on a vast majority of topics on a regular basis on its own self regulating cycle continues to astound me. The simplicity of twitter continues to be its golden fountain that keeps users on their phones, not necessarily contributing to any particular topic, but looking on for comedic content or anything else that may catch their eye (most of the time it's comedic). Twitter is unique in the way users may use the app to release stress by using its interactive features to cope with anything they may be dealing with. Although there are many great things about the app, twitter is not for everyone, ""but if it's not your type of meal don't eat it"" -@queenblackwell (a twitter user that inspires and motivates me)"
"You blocked me once and made me delete a post before you would allow me to use your services again. My Tweet was nothing like some I have seen on here.... 
But for some reason unbeknownst to me, you continue to let Trump destroy our country almost every minute of the day.... every day. Is he paying you or are you just too scared to stand up to him? You could block him, ya know. Maybe he would get some work done...then again, he would probably just throw a temper tantrum and go golf.
I typically stick to the animal posts now.

You also blocked me twice for making WEEK EACH TIME because I told Trump to choke on a Big Mac. I DIDN‚ÄôT TELL HIM TO DIE. Yet you CONTINUE TO ALLOW HIM TO DESTROY OUR COUNTRY. Who cares if you are flagging his Tweets! BAN HIS ACCOUNT. You are discriminating and obviously favor Trump. He has DESTROYED US YET YOU KEEP LETTING HIL TWEET. Not happy with your services, but whatever. I‚Äôll stay nice but you will continue to let Trump destroy us. God job Twitter. Good job Jack. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"In the past year I‚Äôve realized the true power of social media and the people who operate it. I think it‚Äôs time to return ourselves to a simpler time where presidents we‚Äôre getting knobers in the Oval Office and no one cared about Cardi B cutting her but hole with her nails. Take me to a time when I had respect for media of all kinds, the days when Jake tapper and his manipulation of the people was only a far fetched conspiracy theory and not facts caught on tape and denied still because so many people are purely ignorant. I miss the days when I didn‚Äôt know what Kim ate for breakfast lunch and dinner. I don‚Äôt care about rob learning to fish, or Stephen flying a kite. The fact that what we do is solely based around likes and comments on our devices is frustrating. Put it down and join them in person. Push back against the media manipulation and addiction you allow yourself to be a part of. Wash your hands of this cancer to society we call social media"
"Ok so before I start I  wanna say that almost the entire time that I have used Twitter it has always worked but recently it hasn‚Äôt, I was using Twitter yesterday and earlier today and it was working but now it doesn‚Äôt wanna work and it‚Äôs been acting wired as a example I was trying to look at my liked videos and it said I didn‚Äôt have any even tho I knew that I had at least over 100+ so I don‚Äôt understand why it wasn‚Äôt working, it only showed the tweets that I responded too but that was the only thing that showed, I logged out and made a new account, problem solved right? Wrong I made the new account and tried to make it so I could see sensitive content and it wouldn‚Äôt let me and tell me that there was a problem with my Internet connection even tho my internet is fine, I don‚Äôt understand why this is happening like I said it was working yesterday and today so why isn‚Äôt it working now?"
"So here‚Äôs my story window are you coin was at a nickel I bought 30,000 coins. And just like when bitcoin was at pennies if you hung onto it you made a fortune just like the guy that bought the pizza for $50 in bitcoin little did he know that today will be $150,000 for a pizza so it‚Äôs all about speculation in perspective personally I don‚Äôt think getting rid of a few pennies in cryptocurrency is worth it I think sitting at it and waiting for the long-haul is the only way to go be smart be patient wait your turn it will come literally right now I‚Äôm up almost $100,000 for sitting less than actually a year be smart just wait and in the end you really have nothing to loseBut a few pennies anyways 
Peace

"Twitter has impacted my social life greatly. It‚Äôs is an app to share thoughts, photos, ideas, and jokes to all of your followers. In return, you get to see the latest posts from your favorite people. You can see what‚Äôs going on around the globe when you tap on the ‚ÄúNews‚Äù icon. You can also send direct messages to the people you are following, or those who follow you. This complex yet so simplistic app has everything you‚Äôll ever need to be active in a social aspect. It‚Äôs a one-of-a-kind and extraordinary social media application. You won‚Äôt find anything quite like Twitter. Although some apps might be similar, Twitter is special, and it‚Äôs the future of social media. This app is surely connecting the world. What are you waiting for?"
"I am enjoying Twitter and don‚Äôt need to bother my personal friends on Facebook with my political views anymore. However, I am hearing many say their conservative views/tweets are being censored and removed. If I am treated unfairly, I won‚Äôt hesitate to leave Twitter altogether. Twitter should not lean to the left or right. Nor should it remove our posts simply because they go against what Twitter employees believe. We are all Americans and have freedom of speech, even conservatives. This hasn‚Äôt happened to me (yet) but if it does I will object to unfair treatment and will leave. Twitter might not care about that. Just because we don‚Äôt like Hillary, or Obama, or Pelosi, doesn‚Äôt mean we are ‚Äúhateful‚Äù. It just means we think these people are doing things we believe are not in the best interest of the country. So let‚Äôs be fair about that and try not to get things twisted. Thanks for asking for my opinion."
"I have had some fun on Twitter bursting some of hot air balloons that try to float by and encouraging those who obviously just accept all comments they agree with as truth to begin to think for themselves.  
My concern is not for the ignorance of some of those who post, They are entitled to their views but to quote an old bromide, they are not entitled to what they claim to be facts unless they provide the source.
Those who do so demean themselves,.
But my serious concern is allowing the posting of those which contain obscene  and /or demeaning posts. It just seems to lower the seriousness and class of the entire endeavor.  It makes it seem that I am  in a bar with people who have drank too much,  There are other means to express your position,  some can be even more cutting than obscenity."
"Want to edit a tweet you made ? Better open that wallet because any rational feature for 2022 won‚Äôt be available for free. Twitter not only needs profits from advertising they want to bill their users too because the truth is you can speak on Twitter but they hold their users hostage by locking the data down once it‚Äôs in twitters hands. You‚Äôll be tied down to their social platform and can‚Äôt even access the data of yours they profit from. 

Does the app work ? I wouldn‚Äôt know because I refuse to pay for a text editor in 2022 that only allows 180 character sms messages and requires money to reopen your data. It‚Äôs a scam to lock your data into their box and charge you to get it out. Don‚Äôt fall for it, the reach of Twitter must be paid for at this point and you can do better on your own. You‚Äôll be on your own with Twitter as well, so just do it yourself.  This is a clone of Usenet and isn‚Äôt free. Boo these clowns."
"No matter what age you are, Twitter will always have something disturbing. They don‚Äôt delete inappropriate videos until like three hours later, when it‚Äôs already shared and posted everywhere and there‚Äôs no getting rid of it since thousands of people have seen it. I saw people on TikTok talking about a video of a girl slitting her wrist and it showed her bones and blood. It was posted several hours ago so I figured it‚Äôd be down. I did some searching and the video was still up. It was up for literally a whole day and was absolutely disgusting and gory. Twitter does not try to protect the users. There are so many disgusting videos on here. Now people are sharing this video THAT IS STILL UP ON TWITTER  of a guy molesting a woman and I don‚Äôt even want to say what else it shows. There are children on this app, and some of the things in here would even disturb 50 year olds. Absolutely disgusting. They need to do something about it."
"Twitter will tell you that you can use the same phone number on multiple accounts, but this in fact is a lie. I tried using the same phone number I had on a different account and guess what, it didn‚Äôt work. I also tried contacting them multiple times when they locked my account for ‚Äúsuspicious behavior‚Äù that the phone number option they gave never worked, and I also asked them to unlock my account. First account suspended and never unlocked even tho I sent plenty of emails. Second account they suspended, even tho on the two other accounts I enjoyed talking crap to people. But on the third account I didn‚Äôt do anything, I was just minding my own business then they locked it out of nowhere, because ‚Äúsuspicious behavior‚Äù. I contacted them and they still have not responded. Plus my second account has been suspended for over a month, and still no response. Twitter is trash."
"Twitter falsely presents itself as an open forum for the free expression of ideas. In fact & practice Twitter is managed by left wing liberal elites who actively &  aggressively screen, limit and control opinions they do not agree with. Twitter screening is most aggressive & blatantly obvious screening of conservative thought & expression during elections. My old account was shadow banned constantly. My contacts were also banned, blocked & warned. We were NOT promoting violence in any way. We just disagreed with Democrat policies. Twitter does much more harm then good. Twitter has now created echo chambers. Democrats on Twitter and everyone else to Parler or other social networks. I can‚Äôt hope for repeal of 230 because Democrats (supported by Twitter & its employees) rule Congress. Twitter is more restrictive than the CCCP in China.I look forward to 2022 for any hope enough Americans are fed up with being censured and will vote Democrats & 230 protection for Twitter, Google, Apple, Wikipedia, etc...OUT."
"The reply system that was recently introduced was possibly one of the most unnecessary additions Twitter has had in a good long time. I've been using it for a while, and I understand it just fine. There's just one major issue. No one asked for it. The old system worked fine, and there isn't even an option to revert back to the old system. Twitter is forcing a random feature that no one asked for us instead of fixing the things these reviews do ask for. I've never heard a single person say ""Man, it sure is hard looking through twitter replies"" because the old way was fine enough. This app is rated 17+... If someone can't figure out your reply system then they obviously don't have the maturity to use your app. Im sure a lot of people agree with me when I ask, fix this feature or at least let the people who don't care about it switch to the old way."
"As a proud & patriotic American Citizen I never in a million years thought the level of corruption,dishonesty ,fraud & treason against our Country was ever possible as it has been in The 2020 Presidential Election !

President Donald J.Trumps landslide victory over Joe Biden was so in our face rigged at all levels in our democracy it is scary ! 

From Twitter & Facebook burying The Hunter Biden‚Äòs New York Post Story your corporate censorship of everything Trump ! Everything conservative !Everything America ! Has been out right treasonous & despicable to Americans ! 

The states corrupted legislatures wide spread Mass Mail outs of Mail in voting ballots in the battle ground states, corrupted voting machines & media‚Äôs weaponizing of the Coronavirus has been put into play for the purpose of steeling this election from us the 75 million Americans who voted for President Donald J. Trump!

Twitter wealth & success has been because of all of your members having a platform to enjoy our precious 1st Amendment rights of freedom of speech ! This corrupt behavior is going to destroy everything great about Twitter along with Facebook! 

Best Regards! 
Good luck !
God Bless America !

"The entire point of twitter was to connect the world and see what was happening worldwide. Removing worldwide trends was a giant mistake and twitter has only harmed themselves by doing so. Twitter was where I would go to find out news around the world and limiting myself and others from doing so, especially during this worldwide pandemic is censorship and has only made me want to leave twitter. Twitter is censoring what we see by removing this feature, limiting our individual experience and will go downhill because of this decision. I see enough information about my country on other social media‚Äôs and the news, twitter was supposed to connect me to others around the world. The loss of the worldwide trends feature is only dividing us. 

Instead of horrible decisions like this one, maybe listen to your users and create folders in the bookmarks but I guess listening to and improving use for users is too much to ask for."
"Been using this app for years and there‚Äôs one thing about it that grinds my gears. I have Video Autoplay turned on because some while scrolling through my feeds I just rather to watch a video auto play rather than tapping on it and hearing the sound. So I hate the fact that if I‚Äôm scrolling through my feeds and come across a video and I for some reason I put my phone down without exiting the app or locking the phone, that video will play a million times until my battery dies or I come back to the phone. And this happens very often because of my work and the fact that I fall asleep with my phone in my hand all the time. So how about you guys reduce the auto play on videos to about 5-10 times and they it stops so that it won‚Äôt kill my battery. The only other option is to turn auto play off and I don‚Äôt want to."
"Ive been locked out of my account for months now because i was apparently not 13 at the time i made my account. I now turn 16 in a month and I'm still locked out? I have tried very hard to get my account back by constantly contacting Twitter support and searching online for solutions. I found a lot of other people are being locked out even though they are over 13. Now when i click on twitter it says that my account will be unlocked and they will get back to me soon but they haven't gotten back to me and it has been weeks since it said that. I have been very patient waiting for Twitter to get back to me about unlocking my account and i have no info on it. I understand that a lot of other people are having this issue but i haven't seen any reviews saying their account has been unlocked. Nobody is getting taken care of, twitter needs to start helping people and get it together. This is not ok, I want my account back."
"You should never use the Home timeline instead of the Latest timeline because it makes it very easy to miss stuff from people who infrequently post or your friends. This new update adds a bar that makes it super easy to use the wrong timeline by swiping ever so slightly to the right. This on its own isn‚Äôt too bad, but now between the new Home bar, the Spaces bar, and the Navigation bar, none of which goes away when scrolling, plus the Twitter and profile bar that does sometimes go away when scrolling, you now only have 1/3 of your screen in usable space to look at tweets. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where you can only view one tweet at a time instead of a few. This is unacceptable and I‚Äôll be switching to a third party App until they add settings to get rid of all this nonsense. I expected clutter from other apps, but Twitter used to be the superior experience."
"I'm Not Paying For Twitter Blue To Not See Content I Don't Want To See. 

Twitter Get's Paid Off It's User's Data!! 

I'm sick of having to clicked not interested on the same content over 20 times no exaggeration üò©üò≠

nobody wants or cares to see about ""famous"" peoples lives!! it's annoying that just because they pay for PR it has to be stuffed down our face's.

"I've been on twitter since 2010, so I've watched this platform/app evolve quite a bit over the years. 
My number one complaint currently is that they got rid of the Twitter moments tab and changed the way you view and access breaking news. I, and a lot of people absolutely do not like that, and prefer it the way it used to be. 
Also, how hard would it be to make a one time edit button? 
Overall, twitter is one of the best social media sites, better than Facebook in terms of accessing news and finding likeminded people to connect with. They just need to stop doing stupid updates and making changes that no one is interested in. 
Ps: 280 characters is a bit clutch, not going to lie."
"Twitter used to be a good app.. in like 2011. Now with today‚Äôs society, it‚Äôs used to help promote and fulfill agendas of hate speech. I used Twitter for a decent amount of time. I was on Twitter the year or launched with my @. And I thought it was great. But in 2019 all it is.. is memes and long posts that are very derogatory towards men, and ‚Äúwhite people‚Äù. White people this .. and white people that.. I honestly didn‚Äôt even feel safe to reply to anything in case I got a wave of hate and my information would somehow be leaked onto the website. Between that and the females that insist that no man should be allowed to breathe and tweet out every instance where they see a man accomplishing anything.. just to overshadow that with their biased opinion. So goodbye Twitter üëãüèª. I have no regrets deactivating my account and deleting you forever. I can‚Äôt support a company that restricts free speech where they see it fit.. but let the rest of them run amuck. What a mess it has become."
"I‚Äôm an author. I made some accounts for characters from my book, and had them interact with each other in humorous twitter skits. Once, I was suspended temporarily (on my main account. My own fault-perfectly okay with that.) But my character accounts were suspended. I acknowledge that I had too many, too many company identities, one for publishing, one for production, etc. However, I reached out to support to try and resolve the issue, but they never followed up with me. The character accounts in question were always polite and affable to the people they interacted with, and had distinct personalities. I would have gladly given up some of the more superfluous accounts to save the more important ones. My inability to reach reach a human being left me very dissatisfied. I stay on it mainly to follow politics, but that is very depressing, given how the presiden abuses his account to spread dishonest propaganda."
"Twitter recently came out with a new update. Right after your app is done updating and you enter It they ask you to enter your birthday. So I did. Little did I know this would completely lock me out of my account. Twitter was a way I communicated with college coaches and now I am completely enable to do so.. leaving some coaches on read even. I have looked for support emails and numbers and there are none. I‚Äôve emailed their headquarters.. no response. I‚Äôve dmed them on instagram.. no respond. I‚Äôve been locked out of my account due to creating It at an age younger than 13 however I am now 17 years old and am well old enough to be on twitter. They recently have been sending people ways to get back into their account by you having to submit a picture of your drivers license BUT It won‚Äôt even let you submit It. 

Twitter.. something needs to change here and if It doesn‚Äôt I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised how many people who quit using twitter all together."
"This is an app that is really fun for me to go through and such, I get to look at other people tweets, I get to make my own stuff, and I get to even customize my own profile as well. However though, there are some glitches like: 1 like/comment, but there actually is none, it‚Äôs just weird for me to see and I hope it will get fixed soon. Another glitch that I tend to come across is that sometimes when you post 2 things, it might post the second one you made as first, and the first one as second, it‚Äôs something that needs to be fixed and I really hope that would have soon. So overall, these are the things I have to say about this app and the problems I have with it."
"Banning Trump from spreading lies daily all day long has been good in many ways! This has greatly reduced misinformation being retweeted massively and frankly was part of the problem of igniting the fire in people acting in the siege against our democracy. I feel it‚Äôs the right thing to do. Going forward, discussions on a business model for social media that doesn‚Äôt depend on profit per click? Not sure what the answer is but.. people tend to click on sensationalism and yes outrageous lies. What now? 
It‚Äôs a big cocktail party and we don‚Äôt know what each other are drinking or doping. It‚Äôs the Wild West without a marshal. It‚Äôs drama, it‚Äôs comedy, it‚Äôs touching sometimes, but deadly and anti-democracy, I can live without."
"Hello, I‚Äôm reviewing today to mention how awful the support team for Twitter is. I have been suspended multiple times for ‚Äúavoiding suspension‚Äù when I never did anything wrong in the first place. The first time I was suspended was in error considering I never received an email as to why I was suspended on that account. I even emailed them asking to unsuspend me and they haven‚Äôt answered me in months. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on but can someone please answer my email and unsuspend my account and ip/mac address. I‚Äôm pretty sure Twitter is tracking my ip and mac address which leads them to suspending any new account I make, and in all honesty this is just absolutely unfair to me since I never did anything to warrant a suspension in the first place. My Twitter @‚Äòs are yoonbuttons, yooniecube, ondahoiic, and ondaholic. Please answer my emails, I just want to be able to talk to my friends and keep up with my faves. This is getting ridiculous."
"Twitter could be an instrument of and for good if it dealt out punishments for violations equally, but it doesn‚Äôt so it‚Äôs purpose is greatly diminished because of this fact. It uses its ability to limit the free speech of its participants by wealth and levels of fame or participants positions in society. While I can be banned for posting an image of a famous person that Twitter deems ‚Äúinappropriate‚Äù someone like the president can lie, distort facts, and encourage violence, hate, and racism and keep his account active and continue violating Twitters policies. That should not be allowed to happen, inappropriate tweeting should apply to all individuals across the board. If Twitter bans an average participant for behavior they have ruled as offensive, inappropriate or other, what applies to one should apply to all no matter position or fame. Thank you for allowing me a voice."
"I most likely will not be using twitter for much longer. But I am writing this review as a farewell/final attempt to open your eyes to the undoubtedly biggest abuse to freedom of speech since the creation of the greatest nation this planet has ever seen. It is because of that right to say whatever the hell we want; right or wrong, racist or not, offensive or not, that a simple idea like sharing your thoughts on the Internet with each other is called twitter today. But you seem to think the amount of power you‚Äôve gained has made you untouchable. When it‚Äôs the opposite. You have the most to lose, TWITTER. And you‚Äôve lost me. If you do get hit with any violations from the government I will fully support it. And I‚Äôm not alone. You had an opportunity to be heroes in a situation where only a grain of valor was needed. Instead you folded like a chair to the politically correct insane left. What a waste of an opportunity. You should be ashamed. Farewell, TYRANT!!!"
"Absolutely love Twitter, it‚Äôs where I read about all things going on in the world near and far but... the only thing I don‚Äôt like is that I see ‚ÄúLiked Tweets‚Äù on my timeline from the people I follow which have no importance to me. I wish there was an on/off switch for that altogether or an option to turn it off from a specific person/account. Maybe even an option to edit tweets after they are posted, just in case you make an accidental error and don‚Äôt want to go through the hassle of deleting the tweet and writing it back up again ( especially if it was a long tweet) but only the person that wrote it can edit and republish (meaning you can only edit your own individual tweets and not anybody else‚Äôs) if any or all of this happens I‚Äôll love Twitter even more!"
This application is very easy to use and it constantly has a fresh supply a very interesting topics and information from different people. It is a great way to pass the time or to keep up with what is going on in the world. It also makes it very easy to curate your newsfeed by selecting the types of people do you want to follow and it‚Äôs fairly easy to find the people you were looking for. The only negative is that the search function is not super precise and they can be hard to find people who are very common names or if you do not know the specific handle that they are using. It is also somewhat difficult to index specific tweets. Overall a solid up and great for anyone who wants to learn a little more about the world
"Twitter is an awesome app for keeping up with news and what‚Äôs happening whether it be global, work, school, or personal. I, personally, use it to keep up with my favorite content creators so I‚Äôm up to date with all the news, drama, etc. I also use it to post my art and my opinion on things. I don‚Äôt have many followers so nobody really cares what I have to say, but it‚Äôs still fun! The only thing I dislike is 1. There is no ‚Äúedit‚Äù button for tweets, it would help a ton! I know lots of people that would appreciate this, and 2. Twitter can be quite a negative space at times, which I understand isn‚Äôt really Twitters fault, but I think they need to be a little better with what they do and don‚Äôt allow, specifically in the comments"
"Whenever you see that ‚Äúessentials‚Äù logo under an app it calls forth scrutiny as what really is essential to an iPhone.  However I believe that twitter truly is one of the most essential social media platforms on the AppStore. It has the community of Facebook, sharibility of instagram, and all of the world leaders who could destroy us upon a tap of the finger, occasionally tweet out funny things (a different tap of the finger if you will). Twitter is a stream of consciousness journal for some, barring the rise of finstas, a revolutionary platform to others, and a place to laugh for most. Anyone with even a modicum of something interesting to say can say it here. So that‚Äôs why twitter truly is the essential app; because it is the essence of the internet"
I will never buy another Apple product and I own many and suggest others to do the same. Here is why. This app allowed people to threaten to burn stuff down all year invoke violence and those people never had their 1st amendment touched. I had first hand threats. Twitter never touched their accounts and told me to block them if I do not like it. At the same time they put a warning on every single one of my tweets that said they contained harmful information. So I switched to Parler. The next thing I know Apple removes the App!! For NO reason at all. Why have they not removed Twitter? Every day I saw people Tweet death threats to the President and that was OK? Anyone else sick of the double standard here like me. GAB is coming out with a smart phone. Apple just lost over 50% of their customers. There next IPhone will be a flop. They have been going downhill for awhile. Goodbye Twitter and Goodbye Apple. Great job ruining your business.
"Twitter is one of the best apps ever...if your someone who wants to be mind controlled and only ever hear one side of every news story. Twitter is a joke, just as this country is about to be. I don‚Äôt know how so many people are so blind. No wonder Twitter is so popular and so left, it‚Äôs used by all the people either too rich to have to work or too lazy to want to work. This app is horrible and they are taking away our right to free speech. I could tell you the sky is like green right now and I wouldn‚Äôt get fact checked, BUT god forbid I write something that paints PRESIDENT TRUMP in a positive light. It will be fact checked no matter how accurate It is. The people who created this app are a joke and they are just puppets. If you want a real app that allows you to actually exercise your freedom of speech and allows you to view stories from both sides, and the ones in the middle, Parler is your app. Delete this app as fast as you can and run."
"Its great app very fun you can know what other people think around the world but we need translation options like in Facebook and instagram so we can understand others who talk in different languages than us, theres international fan in the world sometimes we follow people or stars from other countries and because they tweet in their own language and don‚Äôt use only English we don‚Äôt understand this makes me upset üò¢ and go to other apps to follow them leaving Twitter, so I hope the Twitter team can add tweets translation options so we can interact with others who can‚Äôt speak in English, wish you will look into my request seriously üòê please, its great app but there‚Äôs always room for improvement üôè"
"Lately I‚Äôve realized that I haven‚Äôt been seeing tweets from a news site that I follow so I checked their profile to see if I accidentally unfollowed or muted them but I didn‚Äôt. Then I thought maybe I just needed to update to the latest version of the app so I did but I still had the same problem. The tweets just... don‚Äôt show up on my timeline, whether it‚Äôs set for me to see top tweets or latest tweets first. üòë It‚Äôs very annoying that I have to go to their profile and scroll through all the tweets that I missed when I could have easily seen it scrolling through just my timeline instead. Now I wonder how many other tweets I‚Äôve missed!!??!? I don‚Äôt seem to have this problem when I use Twitter on my mobile browser though so I guess I‚Äôll be using that for now. üôÑ"
"Not only is this a toxic cess pool of self important ignorance, but there‚Äôs virtually nothing that gets accomplished other than circular arguments and false suspensions. 

I had my account falsely suspended for ‚Äúthreatening and/or violent content‚Äù and after waiting for over a week (filed an appeal of course) Twitter determined to keep my account suspended indefinitely without providing any specific example of me posting threatening content. 

They basically told me to trust their investigation without any actual basis. So any amount of people who decide to report what you post will most likely get your account suspended and twitter won‚Äôt even give you the decency of providing the actual example of what you did that warranted it. Trash app, they aren‚Äôt going to last. Save your time and energy elsewhere."
"Hi so just to start, I love Twitter, I adore it. Without a doubt it will always make me laugh. However, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard of the update they installed that will lock your account if your are not of the appropriate age. I had made my account before I was 13 by changing the year I was born, however I changed it to the actual year this month, I‚Äôm over the age of 13 but once I changed it, it still locked me out of my account. I get it, I lied. However I reported to them that I am now over the age of 13 and I still haven‚Äôt gotten my profile back. They‚Äôve told me that I can get it back, but it almost been a week. I haven‚Äôt had any updates on the status. Twitter has no personal email, so I can email my grievances and ask what my profile status is. I really hope this changes soon because im about to lose it."
"I have had my account locked down for over 10 days now. I have seen others with accounts locked down for as long as a month. Why? Twitter first asks you to input a birthday. They say it could be that of yours, your business or even ‚Äòyour cat‚Äô and I quote. I put my daughters birthday out of mere love. My account got instantly locked down for being ‚Äòunder 13‚Äô though my daughter is EIGHTEEN years old. I have contacted twitter multiple times, sent them IDs for verification, and I received nothing in return. My account is still locked down and I shall receive an ‚Äòupdate‚Äô - not even a solution- next week. Another week with my business account shut!!!!!! Awful customer support. Their bots cannot do basic math I am extremely confused and frustrated. What a shame."
I was told my account won‚Äôt be reactivated because I didn‚Äôt acknowledge or follow the community guidelines and stated that my banner and my profile pics both included nudity/ violent behavior. When neither my banner or my profile pic and EVEN my content include any of that. I will pursue to press charges for defamation and discrimination. On my account I try to avoid any violent or nudity banner or profile pic. I‚Äôm tired of you guys constantly accusing me of doing stuff I did not do. I will pursue to sue if my stuff does not get fixed. I did nothing wrong and I would love to see any evidence of the following in being accused of. My account tells people that I have 18+ content. And my banners is my face and as of my profile pic. Look into it thank you.
"My only real complaint with the twitter platform is it‚Äôs inability to properly and uniformly execute on its own rules, the platform itself makes for a potentially good way to express yourself and reach out to its larger user base. 

My main problem is that after years of using this app casually, I have gotten sick of the pure toxicity of the platforms user base. The trending tabs are fixated on mostly a circle of people just dog-piling a certain matter and getting angry at each other‚Äôs throats. There‚Äôs no debate to be had on this platform, it‚Äôs a place to rant and, with the lack of any real consequences to the average user, express your distaste to those around you. 

It‚Äôs not that good can‚Äôt come out of the platform, but until internet mob mentalities get a grip, the site and app are just to be riddled with feeds that are unappealing and unappreciated."
"To be honest, I‚Äôm literally addicted to this app. Seriously I‚Äôm not even joking. I‚Äôve made friends, found new favorite artists and musicians and such from here, I could say I‚Äôve definitely enjoyed it. But, my account was suspended two days ago for no reason and I wasn‚Äôt even warned once! And the appeal option is clearly not working. An innocent account lost when there are some out there posting very violent, triggering and Gore filled videos and content, which have upset many people I know. To say I‚Äôm deeply upset with this would be an understatement. Now where it‚Äôs suspended I‚Äôve lost contact with many friends and such I won‚Äôt be on much at all or at all. Yes I could make a new account but finding everyone again would be a pain. If my account ever gets appealed maybe I‚Äôll change my mind about the app. But for now I‚Äôm truly upset with the app and won‚Äôt be using it again any time soon."
"I have been tweeting since 2012, and I have come to regard Twitter as a lifestyle.. The social impact is undeniably American.. I love the acerbic nature of the interactions. 

My only problem is that I sometimes feel as tho I‚Äôm being targeted by the administrators, because of my views.. I don‚Äôt mind being challenged, intellectually, but it‚Äôs not cool when I‚Äôm demonized, and reduced to being a simplistic narrative.. I can‚Äôt use a common metaphor that says; ‚Äúgive them enough rope to hang themselves‚Äù.. Obviously, that‚Äôs not ‚Äúthreatening‚Äù, or ‚Äúpromoting violence‚Äù.. Words mean things, and context often changes the meaning. 

I just believe Twitter could be greater if the admin would actually read tweets for the full context, instead of randomly selecting words that are deemed as bad, threatening, or harassing.. Other than that, keep up the good work.."
"I must come forward to say how anti-social this app is. I've usd this since I was a teenager and I'm an adult now is been around ten years more or less. I won't bother how long exactly. and there was never anyone who followed me or replied to me or at least liked my posts. Over the years I  came and left just a few times and I barely get any engagement. Twitter is not a social app, I get tracked via internet too, which is messed up. Ppl copy instead of supporting original content. Supposedly A FEW pf my posts get a lot of attention but out of 30, 50 or 75+ PEOPLE (who just SEE) not one single one wants to like, comment, share, follow. Instead I later see them posting similar posts just like mine or somewhere else . This app need a revamp, because I'm irritated how badly my content has been suppressed for ALOT of years . For others to see and steal instead . My review will change when I see things improve ."
"I like twitter, i really do, i find it useful & i totally love Jack & square & basically whatever he has his hands in... but i am more of a centralist.  If i were only conservative, i would find their bias atrocious.   Unfortunately none of these social media companies really want ‚Äúindependent, un-biased fact checkers‚Äù what they really want are ‚Äúindependent narrative checkers,‚Äù otherwise they would do personality tests to find actual analytical ppl who can put their own personal beliefs and emotion aside to merely determine authenticity of an article, statement, etc. By missing the mark, they have setup the federal govt to offer some non-sensical solution to a problem on a platform they can hardly use."
"You guy who run Twitter are a bunch of cry babies who can‚Äôt take a joke. Censoring ‚Äúharmful‚Äù replies and blocking accounts for us... go kick rocks you bunch of sissies. I bet you‚Äôll censor this comment too won‚Äôt you? You bunch of door knob suckers. All you ‚Äúcreatives‚Äù at Twitter have no authentic ideas, all you nannies do is steal other ideas from different social media platform and try to pawn them off as your own ideas. You guys were the teacher pets and snitches is high school. Bunch of virgins. I bet you‚Äôll take offense that I called you ‚Äúguys‚Äù in the last and first sentience. I come on Twitter to watch funny videos and read funny posts. You aren‚Äôt news, you‚Äôre as reliable as CNN and I‚Äôm not even political. (That was an insult). Let us have fun on here. No one is forcing a user to get on Twitter every day, this doesn‚Äôt need to be safe space. I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôll probably get canceled or blacked now for speaking my mind that I have the right too."
"I can‚Äôt say I don‚Äôt like Twitter because i use it as my primary social media platform. I even bought stock.  That would be a contradiction. It‚Äôs strength is hearing from everyone from celebrities to politicians to no-names from all walks of life and ideological leanings...in short form!  Perfect. 

The concern?  Censorship. A couple of years ago I decided to keep using it but I sold my stock. I loathe the concept that Twitter employees or those they contract can see themselves as arbiters of ‚Äútruth‚Äù ‚Äúdisinformation‚Äù or even extremism. They are obviously and hopelessly ideologically driven and blinded. Be American and risk allowing it all (except obvious calls to violence). As of now, Twitter is arbitrary in their enforcement of their rules. I‚Äôve seen examples and I only think that will grow. Stop. Let speech run. We‚Äôre adults. We will sort it out."
"I know Twitter is a ‚Äúprivate company‚Äù but they are so biased they‚Äôre censoring the POTUS and his supporters by putting ‚Äúthis claim about election fraud is false‚Äù on almost all President Trump‚Äôs tweets and other people like his staff, Republican senator, governors, and politicians that support him they do the same claim disputes. They‚Äôve also gone as far as to ban a bunch of Republican politicians, lawyers, Trump Supporters and even THE POTUS! Completely out of fear that maybe some people will wake up from the brainwashing done by the corrupt media and the corrupt politicians on both sides. The fact that they‚Äôre actively banning conservatives and taking a platform to promote our ideas and opinions from us just isn‚Äôt right. I will be tweeting my opinions and ideas until Twitter bans me. Download Parler if you want a place to be allowed to have different opinions and ideas and share them freely. God bless you all have a good one."
"Often times, you will find yourself reported or suspended for certain time. Other times, you will find that your account has been suspended for no reason. You can‚Äôt talk to a real person, about this. Not by email, text, or phone. I‚Äôve had my account suspended four times. I don‚Äôt speak any differently on Facebook, and it has not yet once been suspended, in 10 years.I come to Twitter to read the new stories, primarily now. Also, there are different rules for different people. Some kid who quoted everything Trump said, got his account suspended. Trump writes somethimg, and there‚Äôs a warning label.   Twitter get your act together!"
"I like Twitter, although if your new to it it can be hard to navigate around and takes some time to get used to. I mainly use twitter to catch up on the celebrity‚Äôs and see what‚Äôs going on with them, I can say it is hard to get people to ‚Äúfollow‚Äù you on your account and is definitely way different than Facebook where you can just send a friend request and become friends with someone, on Twitter if you follow someone they don‚Äôt always follow back so it looks like you have little to no ‚Äúfollowers‚Äù and shows hundreds of people your following and if you post something no one sees it so that‚Äôs a buzz kill, I really do prefer Facebook over Twitter unless I‚Äôm curious to know what the celebs are up to."
"I truly value the ability to see and hear what celebrities, government officials and fellow folks from the general populace say and feel about current events and life in general. The value of seeing the actual words of the actual officials, specialists and other famous folks is enlightening. Whereas communicating with fellow citizens and select social group members is also comforting. Also appreciate the ability to reach out and support others. Yet the major drawback is the problem with fake accounts or malicious bots which try to either attack members, spread lies and propaganda, ‚Äúphish‚Äù for personal data or otherwise interfere with the open exchange of real points of view and valid information."
"I absolutely LOVE Twitter. It‚Äôs hands down my favorite social media app to use. It‚Äôs never given me a problem, even when others would complain about a wide scale issue. I‚Äôve never been affected... until now. Now i‚Äôm not sure if other users are having this problem but for the past 3 weeks I‚Äôve noticed that when I get notifications or DMs on Twitter, the app‚Äôs icon (on my home screen) will show that I have them, but once I open the app, the notifications are gone (as if I hadn‚Äôt actually received any) and I can‚Äôt tell what type of notifications I‚Äôve received. The only way I can find out is by actually pressing the notification or DM tab within the app. It‚Äôs a small issue that over time, is actually quite annoying. Please fix the issue, bc I want the old perfectly functioning Twitter back :("
"I really enjoyed twitter at first ...breaking news at my fingertips 24 hours a day.  I typically use twitter for political information and it became painfully apparent, as a Trump supporter, that twitter plays favorites!  The news section is always pro liberal/Democrat and constantly portrays Trump and the GOP in a negative way.  I got to about 6k followers and all of a sudden my hashtag tweets are no longer visible and I started losing 10 followers per day...shadow banned for being a Trump supporter!  Don‚Äôt believe me?? It happens constantly....conservative speech gets shut down, suspended, and kicked off (just look at Laura Loomer) but nothing ever happens to the radical leftists.  Very disheartening that this is where we are as a society.  Of course, Twitter and Jack deny deny deny, but anyone with a pulse acknowledges this as truth.  So....yes twitter can be a great source for entertainment but if you‚Äôre a Republican and especially a Trump supporter prepare to be frustrated!"
"Hey Twitter i love the app and the site, and i avidly use twitter moments!!! I‚Äôm just asking to make moments more fluid. When i edit them, things get stuck. I put moments in moments to create a sort of book. I actually play a game where we create stories right on twitter through tweets. using moments, we can collect the story and make it into a book our following can read. But i need more power in moments. Could it hold more tweets? And yes even put moment links within moments without links crashing, or worse getting shadowbanned. So now my followers click my moments link and it will pop up as nonexistent, the moment i worked so hard to put together! I see it when i click the link, but my followers don‚Äôt. If they didn‚Äôt tell me i wouldn‚Äôt even know. So yes, please improve twitter moments i think it has great potential!"
"This is definitely an app that you make it to be. Based on who or what organizations you follow and interact with; this app can be anything from daily news, comedy,  musician Stans, sports... you name it. I say adult because explicit posts are not filtered in this app as well but you do have the option of not following, blocking, and reporting posts that are distasteful, harmful, threatening etc. 

I‚Äôve been using this app since 2011 to follow world news, social activism, music rumors, science/medicine, and funny posts (Black Twitter shouldn‚Äôt be free). 

I also block phrases or triggering words from my feed so that I am not seeing anything I don‚Äôt want to (works most the time)."
"When Twitter implemented the ‚Äúhide the search column""I jumped right on using it. You would go to privacy in settings, and then to display and sound and right there would be ""hide the search column"". This was useful to me because I am dyslexic and by hiding the search column, I could stay focused on Twitter without the excess clutter on the side. Lately I am unable to find the feature anymore when I go to privacy and settings and then display and sound. That‚Äôs where it used to be. I‚Äôve checked accessibility and it‚Äôs not there, either. Devs- please tell me where it went. It was incredibly useful to me and I‚Äôm sure others as well. Thanks.

This was first implemented in version 8.71 and I‚Äôve had each update since. Was it removed?"
"Still no help from Twitter help in fixing the problem on my phone, have sent 2 request now! I have literally spent hours & hours trying to solve the problem &have now given up, as it‚Äôs been weeks now! Have no choice but to delete the app!
 Not working on my iPhone! I keep Getting the same message over & over & over, every account I click on ‚Äúsomething went wrong‚Äù Try again Of course can hit try again over & over & it does not work! This has been going on for almost a week now! I have checked and updated the iPhone & Twitter app everytime there is an update available! Have signed out & signed in on several occasions, still will not work! Have changed password & still does not work! I have also deleted the app & reinstalled! Have turned the phone off & turned back on again! I have spent hours trying to find, fix the problem!"
"I can‚Äôt access my account because of their updated privacy policy or something so they deleted my information (while I was still logged into the app) for privacy reasons I assume, I got a new phone, & now I can‚Äôt log in even though all of the info I‚Äôve typed in is correct. I take note of all my passwords so I didn‚Äôt forget it. Basically I‚Äôm locked out of my account for no reason. I‚Äôve tried contacting support multiple times & they‚Äôve done absolutely nothing. The only reason why I want to retrieve my account now is so I can delete it! Permanently! Especially after this. But if that‚Äôs not enough for you, let‚Äôs talk about the countless other garbage things about Twitter! For ex: it‚Äôs literally become porn, tea that nobody cares about, celebs beefing for no reason, MAD fake woke people, etc. Sis, I‚Äôll save you the trouble: don‚Äôt even bother lol there‚Äôs better apps‚Ä¶this is coming from a gen-z‚Äôer born in 1997‚Ä¶"
"I believe twitter to be a good source for information and conversation. However, the fact that you allow Donald Trump to tweet is dividing and hurting America. It cheapens your social media platform lowering standards to that of the National Enquirer. You should set the bar and go the extra mile to fact check (a new phrase made famous by Trumps inaccurate tweeting). Ban Trump from Twitter. Do it.  Make it a win-win for America. Don‚Äôt give him a platform to spew his hateful rhetoric.  This isn‚Äôt political,  it‚Äôs common sense. Set the standard for social media responsibility. I may be dumping FB and encourage all of America to do the same. Twitter may be next. I‚Äôll go back to picking up a news paper and Time Magazine. Dump Trump, America will thank you."
"You get one star, only because zero stars was not an option. Your company breathes fresh life into ideas that we have fought against for centuries. Most notably the suppression of ideas and expressions. You epitomize one of the most dangerous policies the world has known in the suppression of free speech. You wield a great power with an irresponsible and bias heart. The silencing of thought is a pillar of tyranny and while you may believe you wouldn‚Äôt misuse an unchecked power, you cannot possibly account for those who inevitably will succeed you. While I believe you think you‚Äôre doing the right thing, you are in fact resuscitating an evil that has cost millions of lives throughout the course of humanity. Not only the big name Hitler, but every victim of sexual abuse every person ever enslaved. Their voices were stolen too. And now here your company is, leading the charge to normalize silence. 

Yes one star, because zero wasn‚Äôt available."
"Hi, 

I have suggestions. 

1) for mega-users like me, it‚Äôs annoying when I see the same tweet multiple times. Example: I read a tweet by CNN. Then, eight hours later, my timeline has the same tweet again, from eight hours ago, and the only only thing that changed is that someone I follow liked it. I don‚Äôt need my timeline updated with a Paul Begala endorsement. 

2) for threads that build slowly over hours or days, don‚Äôt re-insert the whole thread into my timeline. Just add the new stuff, or don‚Äôt insert it in my fresh timeline at all

3) let‚Äôs say I follow BuzzFeed, and they post the same exact story about Billie Eilish four times. If I‚Äôve seen it, can you make it stop appearing in my timeline repeatedly?

4) can you add a guideline to the nickname screen so people know that only, like, twelve characters are going to show?

5) the mid-reading refresh scroll has got to go!

6) I still strongly dislike the big blue  compose tweet circle over my timeline. 

Okay, those are my suggestions for now. Hope some are useful. Thanks for building such an addictive, interesting app. Good luck slaying the election misinformation bots!

Karen Zachary"
"I‚Äôve had my Twitter account for some time now, but have only just started using it since February or so when the Chinese coronavirus started and we‚Äôve all been quarantined! I wish Twitter would make their guidelines more clear. My account was suspended this past week for what I don‚Äôt know! It had been suspended one other time for a day, but this time it was suspended for 5 days! Was the suspension for following too many people too fast? Was it for having a disproportionate number of followers and those I‚Äôm following? I only have approximately 3664 followers and those I‚Äôm following (3636) are about the same number. However, I‚Äôll have to admit that at the time I was suspended, I was much more overweight on those I followed. Is this ‚Äúguideline‚Äù spelled out somewhere? Wish I‚Äôd known!"
"Twitter used to be my favorite social media, I‚Äôve been a user for 7 years. I had many friends on the site, and I always loved interacting with my favorite celebrities on there as well. But recently I went to update my birthday, and guess what? They locked my account. I was 11 when I made my account, and technically you‚Äôre supposed to be 13 when you make a twitter. And I understand that, but seriously. You‚Äôre locking my account 7 YEARS after I made? I had a backup account, but it isn‚Äôt nearly as good as it was when I had my other account. I‚Äôm so upset about it, it‚Äôs been over a month and I still haven‚Äôt heard anything about getting it unlocked. I‚Äôm SO disappointed and honestly thinking about just stopping my use of twitter unless I ever get my other account back. It‚Äôs so frustrating."
"Twitter needs to step up its game with pornography. I don't even know why they allow it. I set up my twitter so that sensitive content would be hidden, which is a good feature in theory. HOWEVER, the supposed ""sensitive content"" is usually 100% harmless while actual pornographic profiles never seem to be blocked. 
Why do you allow pornographic materials on your site? Just because it's too much of a hassle to get rid of? No that can't be the case because your constantly hiding INNOCENT PICTURES!!! Y'all have the time!! I'd like to not be traumatized by a woman covered in blood penetrating herself with a knife again please. 
And I also don't like the idea of a favorite platform of mine promoting the industries that exploit, degrade, and objectify women. So I don't see why you can't just take down pornographic twitter profiles. Facebook does it. Hell, even Tumblr does a better job at hiding nsfw content. That's saying A LOT."
