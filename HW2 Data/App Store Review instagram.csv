"My ISP is only 1.2Mbps. The new features of instagram appears to download the new ""stories"". I'm not sure what it is doing but it takes fifteen minutes or more before it is completed whatever it is that it wants to cache up and I finally get a decent response time when I poke a new picture or try to view a new video. The other major flaw with Instagram is there are only about 12 good pictures on the whole site but everyone reposts the same picture over and over and over again. The ""Explore"" feature brings up the same pictures and videos. I'm not really exploring anything but just reliving the past. A repost should not actually create a new entity but just link to the old and all the original credits and all the likes should go to the originator. Its practically impossible to find out who took the original image. As a site to share photos, it seems very lacking to me.

Update: There is no way to post except via the app and then you can only post from your photo roll (it seems — please tell me if I’m wrong).  This is incredibly frustrating because my photos come from cameras — not my iPhone.  Plus, the upload could pull all the keywords and metadata from the existing photograph but it doesn’t.  Basically, please make it more of a place to post pictures.  The video length limit of 60 seconds is also lame."
"I have had troubles with the music feature on instagram for MONTHS now. I am not able to use any music other than the few automatically shown ones that are there when I click the option, and all the songs are in some foreign language or they're instrumentals of some sort. I am not able to search for any song whatsoever as it will just tell me there are no results every time. A couple months ago, i was still at least able to save a song if someone sent it to me, then go to saved music, and use it through that. But now the problem has worsened and I am not even able to save any music nor see/use any of the music i had saved before this was an issue. I have reported this problem to instagram multiple times over the course of about 5 or 6 months and they have yet to 

respond in any sort of way, let alone fix the problem. I know i'm not the only one dealing with this as i've seen in reviews, as well as on other social medias such as twitter, that there have been a good amount of other people dealing with the same issues. This problem has been aggravating and upsetting, and the fact that i and many others have tried to reach instagram to fix this issue, yet have not even been addressed, only adds to those emotions. The music was one of, if not THE most used feature for me on instagram. I have tried multiple methods on my own to resolve this issue but nothing has worked. Hoping instagram can get to the bottom of this sooner rather than later"

"first off i’d like to say that i’ve been using instagram since 2015. i’ve seen some changes over the course of these past few years that were very good for the overall use of the app, and some that just made navigating the app more difficult. the main reason why instagram has become so popular over the years was it’s simple layout that made it easy to access and interact with followers and discover people. but now, in 2020, likes and view counts are hidden, the feed isn’t in chronological order, the algorithm only allows you to see posts of only a handful of people you follow, and now the notifications have moved. if instagram wants to keep its users satisfied, then they need to go back to the classic look. keeping the classic layout with home, explore page, upload, notifications, and profile at the bottom makes the app easier to navigate. there is no reason why the shopping bag needs to be on the bottom bar because not everyone shops from instagram. there are a lot of scammers on the app! instead of changing the layout, instagram needs to fix the algorithm, put posts on the timeline back in chronological order, get rid of bot and spam accounts, and remove accounts/posts that don’t follow the community guidelines. now more than ever, there are many accounts that spread hate and misinformation! why was changing the layout a priority? fix it and bring likes and view counts back!"
"It would be 100x better without visible likes. And another 100x better if my post showed up in my followers feeds in the order it was posted. It’s not right that I put in so much effort and time, and people who intentionally followed me don’t see my post right away unless they are actively searching for my posts on a regular basis. Choosing to follow an account should be enough, why should I have to go out of my way to like and comment on their posts in order to keep seeing their posts higher up in my feed? Just because I don’t like posts by old high school friends who don’t know how to use a camera doesn’t mean I don’t want to see their photos, doesn’t that make sense? And if I have 3000 followers, I would expect at least 2000 of them to see my post. Why is it that only 500 or less of them see my post? Over time, I have posted better content, and I’ve posted more consistently, I try to post to my story regularly, I try interacting with followers, why is it that my engagement has steadily declined?

Update: I’ve spent 10+ years on this app, posting high quality content, using the new features, and Instagram still treats my account like it’s worthless. I see garbage accounts get blasted with attention and gain thousands of followers, meanwhile, I’ve barely scraped by. And now people are getting paid by Instagram to create reels, and I’ve been posting reels, and Instagram won’t even roll out that feature to me? Unreal."
"Instagram is a great app to use on your free time and to connect with other people. This is why I was really interested in using Instagram to try and help out my barber career. The one annoying issue I’m having is when it comes to trying to add an action button for booking. I have tried this with three different booking apps so far and with no luck. For example I am trying to add my square appointments app as a book option on my business account. The videos I have seen about how to do this, show that once you click on the app you use to schedule your clients, you need to enter in the URL that will link them to your booking page. I believe this is where the problem is. Instagram doesn’t give me an option to enter a URL. The order that Instagram sends me is ( connect website > please select business to connect > connect to Instagram > connection successful). Then when I refresh my page there is no action button. I have used three different booking apps in hopes that one of them would work and none of them do. I have the online booking option turned on within the app as well and it still doesn’t work. It’s extremely frustrating and to add onto it, I can’t find anywhere online to help me. There’s no way to contact Instagram, at least from what I have seen and it feels like it’s never going to work for me. This app could easily be a 5 star, but this one problem is really making it hard."
"Instagram has more potential than it has now. But a few issues are what keeping them from pulling out of from the others. 

First is the amount of bots, fake, and duplicate accounts that are on IG. Myself and some others  (possibly) use IG as a place for photography, businesses, reaching a broader community to share the similar likes, or just for fun. With those few listed accounts, it limits who can see your posts and your account. I can see/understand if someone has a business and personal account. But to have 3+ accounts that are the exactly the same and are troll pages then why keep them up? 

Also there are times especially now (not sure if it’s happening to some people or not) is accounts and people who are clearly going against the TOS and guidelines with their posts and accounts. No matter if it’s drugs, tobacco, alcohol, nudity or sexual images. Some are showing up in popular feed (whatever it’s called) and some though scrolling through posts. Like earlier yesterday/today I tried reporting dozens of posts and accounts of completely naked women and a few of drugs and tobacco in use that showed up and all IG said was that “it doesn’t go against their guidelines”. How does all of this not go against the guidelines?? Also reported a account that supposedly had gotten “removed” on a couple different occasions but still on their as of yesterday with basically no consequences other than a couple pictures that were reported and removed. So I don’t know."
"I've been using Instagram since 2013 and every update I've gotten since then has been disappointing. This newest update (version 166.1) is one of the most annoying and ugliest looking updates yet. First of all, why would I want to connect Facebook messenger to my Instagram account?? It's so unnecessary and of course the DM feature on Instagram is basically mutating into Facebook messenger with the message reactions and the different colored messages. Secondly, the shopping feature being on the bottom bar is the absolute worst. I've never shopped on Instagram and never will but I'm stuck with this completely useless button on my toolbar and I always accidentally hit it when I just want to take a peak at the explore page. Thirdly, the reels feature is absolutely awful (I know that was from a previous update) and I hate that I have the reels icon on my toolbar. The toolbar in general is getting way too confusing and too many things are getting added to it. The fact that I can't even post a photo from my toolbar is probably the most annoying feature. I love Instagram and every time I get an update I just say to myself ""Well, I guess I'll give it a try"" but all of these updates that have happened in the last 1-2 years have pushed me over the edge. Probably going to delete the app because these updates have been nothing but awful ever since Facebook took over. Hate what they've done with it. Stop trying to turn Instagram into Facebook."
"literally the worst app. i used to enjoy using instagram a lot, however in these past years it’s gotten more glitchy and has more issues. Not to mention the fact that they also removed their customer support email, so now there is virtually no way to solve your issues with instagram(the phone call doesn’t go through). Recently I was reposting a flyer for a high school club event that I wanted people to attend and instagram took the story down, claiming that it was against community guidelines,but offered no reason why. Why would a flyer for a high school club fit into any of the categories mentioned in their community guidelines? I tried different variations of the story, but all of them were deleted by instagram. I decided that I would request a review of the action taken against my story, but discovered that instagram says “Review Request Failed, please try again!” every time I pressed it. So not only can I not contact customer support, I also can’t request a review of an unfair decision that they made. I then decided to try posting the exact same story on a different account of mine and to my surprise it posted on that one. So essentially, instagram is only blocking my account from posting any stories through some weird glitch that I am unable to report to them or request review for. Until they are able to open a way for people to easily contact customer service and stop having useless glitches like the one mentioned above, instagram will be a one star app."
"Instagram is perhaps the application I use the most, and I really enjoy it when it’s at its best. However, the flaws are simply overwhelming at times. I’m writing this review because my account has been wrongfully shadow-banned and action blocked over 6 times now without an actual just cause for it. Every time, it says I was allegedly “sharing my account with a service that helps me get more likes and followers” even though that’s blatantly untrue. I have 0 posts, 0 likes and well under 1000 followers. I have written 4 detailed reports explaining my situation but it has been to no avail. Every time this happens, I’m forced to change my password, I’m logged out of my account and then I’m action blocked for an entire week. Every time I try to like or comment, it gives me the option to report it if I believe they have made a mistake but nothing works. My account is never checked, my week long action blocks are never reduced or lifted, my reports are never acknowledged and I’m always getting wronged. I also really dislike the fact that I cannot easily contact anyone from Instagram to help me with issues like these, I can only leave long, written reports for you to ignore and do nothing about. Please revise your algorithms and consider having a Tech Support line with human responders for unique and recurring problems like this one."
"I used to love Instagram as a way to keep in touch with my family and friends. Especially during this time of being apart. However, now with the unbelievable amount of ads it is nearly impossible to see what I want to see (my family and friends) and due to the new - “you’re all done” feature I constantly miss posts and here is why: If I open my feed and look at some posts from friends, I can see there are several I haven’t scrolled to look at yet, I then click over to open a message, when I look back at Instagram those posts are gone and I cannot see them again unless I can possibly remember who posted something and to individually look at each of their pages. I HATE that feature that is now in Instagram. To me the benefit of the posts is I can always just scroll down to review them. Now each post is pretty much a story, see it once and it’s gone forever and now I have ENDLESS ads. Once you have viewed your new posts you can’t see them again all you see are ads.  Don’t get me wrong, I do like SOME ads, they are personalized and helpful. But I’d rather they show up only in my stories than on my feed. I’m probably going to delete Instagram as soon as I can find a different way to see friends and family’s posts and not miss any because of the inundation of ads that is here. Intagram used to be about connecting, now it is just advertising."
"Everything was fine in the beginning. But now the app is FILLED with bugs. I go to open insta and all of a sudden I have the old layout. No more reels button, that’s where the post button is now. And I’ll go and open and close the app to see if it helps but it stays the same, but when I go to another account it still has all of the new features. 
Also, there is an audio bug to where if my phone closes for a sec and I reopen it, the sound of the post it closed on will play over everything. Even if I scroll and play a new video, it plays over it. If I go to close the app, it’ll STILL play even tho it’s not suppose to (and I have background interactions blocked on my phone) 
Also, the “you’ve reached the end of all recent posts, so here’s some from yo suggested feed!” Has got to stop. 
I follow those people for a reason. You don’t even SHOW every post the people I follow make. You only post the most recent ones, as in within about 7 hours, then take away all that and put your own stuff. I have a suggested feed and a following feed for a reason, there was no need to combine the two and I literally missed the fact that I’m an UNCLE because the post was made more than a day ago since I was last on, and didn’t find out until two weeks later when they made a post on their story about my nephew. 
You keep digging yourself in a hole insta, stop putting new things in and just fix what’s already here. There’s enough that’s broken, don’t put more"
"Instagram has made it even harder for you to see posts from the people that you actually follow with this most recent update. I now only see about 10

- 12 photos from people I actually follow, before I get to the ""you've been caught up"" message & suggested posts start popping up. I follow 200+ people, 80% of whom update regularly, yet instagram is making it impossible to see them. I miss so much time sensitive information, including sales, events or donations, all because instagram has moved explore page posts to your home feed as well. And posts are being BURIED with this new update. Half the time the ""new"" posts on my timeline are 1-2 weeks old & the posts in my ""older"" tab are from the same day. As a creator myself, my engagement has dropped exponentially, as Instagram is making it increasingly difficult for my work, & the work of others, to be seen.

And that's not to mention the horrific placement of the new reels tab, dead in the center of the app, with the new shop page directly right, kicking both the post button & the notifications tab to the top of the screen on the home page. As a small business, this is FRUSTRATING to say the least. It seems like instagram is hell bent on punishing the very people that keep their app alive. At the very least, give people the autonomy to organize their app tabs the way they want to & choose to have a chronological home feed or an algorithmic based one. Come on Instagram, lets do better."
"I like Instagram. I do. It’s a good app for keeping in contact with friends and for being able to share the things I create as an artist. But I swear the app gets worse with every update. The changes to the layout of the home page that make it so it’s basically a second explore page and so you don’t see posts from those you follow in chronological order are frustrating. The change to messages that make it so swiping prompts a reply to someone rather than exiting is confusing and non-intuitive, not to mention outright useless. The changes to the placement of the notification and posting tabs are infuriating. This is an app for sharing, not for shopping. Keep the shopping tab out of the main tab bar and put reels back with explore.

Instagram would be much more user friendly if there was an option to toggle certain features (although calling them features instead of “hinderances” might, in some cases, be generous), such as the swipe-to-reply in messages, the suggested posts after the most recent posts in the home section, or whether posts were ordered algorithmically or chronologically. Additionally, allowing users to set up the layout of their tab bar would also make it more user friendly. I’m sure someone out there prefers the easy access to the reels tab, and would want to keep it where it currently is. But most don’t. Thus, allowing users to choose which features show up on the bar would make the app far better."
"The app works for what it needs to work as. But for whatever reason, the user interface constantly changes and there is absolutely no indication that it is meant to change in their version history updates. It becomes slightly irritating that the app will work one way one day and the next some random change will be made to either the explore page or the home page that just doesn't make sense based off of its history. My example right now would be the new reels that were introduced. Now when I go on the explore page there is a huge portion of it being taken up by reels that I don’t want there. Sure, reels is cool but I went to the explore page, not the reels page. Another example that also happened recently was where I opened the app one day and my home page didn’t show any of the pages I followed and instead showed random pages. It took me a minute until I realized I had to click on “see older posts” before I could see the old posts. Not that I care for this too much, but it was just irritating for no reason to suddenly have pages I don’t follow showing up in the section of the app meant for only pages that I follow. That’s about all I can remember but there has been a history other similar changes in the past as well that I vaguely remember."
"The new update is absolutely annoying. I can’t see recent posts without having to click on older posts from people I follow. And if I don’t click on that it just displays ONE new picture from someone I follow. Every time I get on this app all I see is that. Which at this point has gotten on my nerves. Just that one recent picture which is 7 hours old now. Even if I refresh the page I don’t get an update of recent posts with other people I follow. Before the new update it changes constantly and I know some people that I do follow post on a daily basic. Change the format back. I rather scroll on my feed to see post of people I FOLLOW. Not the stupid suggest posts on my feeds. Change it back to how it was. This is incredibly stupid. It’s more stupid having another button to see older posts on my personal page. Stop putting explore page videos/posts of people I do not follow on the personal page. I get on Instagram multiple times a day and I do use the explore page a lot. Keep the personal page separate from the explore page. That is beyond ridiculous. Why are you changing the format? I don’t want to see suggested posts on my personal page. Change it back to where when I scroll on my personal page, it just displays posts from people I follow. Stop including the explore page on the personal page. KEEP THEM SEPARATE. Literally have a personal page button and an explore page button for a reason. Keep it that way."
"Insta has always been about sharing. Sharing your own pictures, and sharing friends or mutual’s work too. The newest update makes the latter impossible and tedious. Instead of being able to simply tap the airplane icon next to a post, and then posting it to your story, you have to back out of it, go to your story, set up a new “create” post, and add a reshare sticker. This makes resharing on the fly incredibly annoying. It slows the spread of posts, and is basically discouraging people from sharing others work in the first place. This is detrimental to communities like activists, artists (who you don’t seem to care much about anyways), content creators, and more. You are effective killing the main source communication and collaboration within your app. Whether you think videos are the hit new thing or not, you ARE NOT TIKTOK. Stay in your lane, or you’ll lose every loyal user. If you’re trying to be something completely new, then make a new app, and leave Insta alone! Nobody comes to Instagram expecting TikTok like content, and that will never change no matter how hard you push that type of content. If you actually care about the stability of your user base, and the Insta community as a whole, please return the old resharing. You can keep your Reels, sure, I don’t care, but removing the biggest part of your app in hopes that it will make everyone want to only look at Reels content is a terrible idea."
"I've been using instagram since 2012, and I used to love the platform so much. However recent changes in the functionality of the app have been making me consider fully deleting my account. First the algorithm was changed from seeing most recent posts first to posts you interact with most, which makes it so you don't see over half of the content from creators you're following and your followers don't see your posts. Then this new update replaced the notification and post tabs with reels and shop, which seriously effects it's usability. Now my notifications and post buttons are in an awkward hard to reach spot, instead of being easily accessible. Everyone I've asked have agreed that this new update is terrible, and that NO ONE cares or asked to have a whole shopping section on a photo sharing platform. This update feels like Instagram is desperately trying to pull users from other apps like TikTok and Pinterest instead of focusing on its own user base and their wants. I am so incredibly disappointed in Instagram's team for consistently refusing to acknowledge their user's concerns. If this update isn't reversed and/or if more terribly inconvenient updates are released, I'm definitely going to be leaving the platform. Furthermore, try implementing useful updates such as being able to reorder or remove photos from old posts. I think such feature would resonate well.

Please, just listen to your user base for once."
"I can never say that an instagram update has ever thrilled me in recent years. Every single time this app has a massive overhaul, the controls become even more clunky and jammed together, I don’t even know what it’s trying to be anymore. I’ve been on this app for 7 years. In those 7 years, the notification/activity tab has been in the right corner, just left of the account button. So it baffles me as to why someone would feel the need to move it to the most unconventional place possible. It is so terribly out of the way now, and not only that, it’s been replaced with a shopping button, so every time my dumb ADHD self goes to check my notifications, I’m sent to some bootleg Wish page. To whichever one of you working at instagram decided to cram the activity button into the top corner with 2 other tabs, I truly hope you have an awful day. Just an unpleasant time. I hope you get a parking ticket, and your car runs out of gas. And you go to the kitchen to find your spouse has tried a new recipe for dinner, and it’s just not very good. And your computer crashes at a very inconvenient time, and you were using an adobe product and forgot to save recently, so you lose a lot of progress on whatever garbage your team concocted to ruin the experience of your user base. I truly despise you."
"Huge decline here. It’s never been particularly impressive (to me) as a photos tool, but there WAS a critical mass of users which meant that you could reliably expect your social group to be there somewhere. Not anymore; in my experience, at least a dozen friends, in the past 12 months, have outright deleted IG AND Facebook simultaneously, suggesting strongly that IG is not an app that’s “killer” enough to overcome the tsunami of Facebook deletions. There are 2 dozen other photo apps in the iOS store at present with more features, better integration, faster processing & less battery drain than what you can find with Instagram. iPhone’s photo editing tools are so much superior to IG that it sort of baffles me why anyone with a modern handset would want to use those features. Even though I only ever perused this app for maybe 5 minutes per week by the time I cancelled, its battery consumption was routinely in the top 10, per the phone’s metrics. In fact, upon a quick check now, I see that despite deleting the app early this week, it *still* managed to book a 2% consumption of my weekly battery usage, which I’m sorry, but that blows me away. 

What on earth was this app doing to my handset in the background?! I just don’t care anymore, and when I deleted it finally, I went from needing a full recharge by 3pm to not even needing to charge *at all* through bedtime. That was a stunning confirmation of my suspicions."
"So I’ve had this app since before it became extremely popular. I’ve always loved this app so much but lately the rules have been so ridiculous! I can hardly comment on people’s posts now without being blocked. It’s been happening pretty much every day. I’m constantly having to write to instagram letting them know that I’m blocked and to please unblock me. I feel like this is a social media app but we’re getting punished for being “too social”. It really takes away the fun of using it when I’m constantly being blocked. I get that there are spam accounts but there are a ton of people getting blocked that aren’t spam accounts. It’s getting a little bit ridiculous lately. A lot of us like to enter giveaways and comment on each other’s posts and we’re getting punished for using the app. I really hope something can change and this can get fixed because it’s really taking away the fun of using the app. I really truly love this app so much but all these rules and getting banned constantly is just so frustrating and really ruining my experience using this app. 

So please, please, please fix this so we can stop getting blocked constantly. I know a LOT of people would really, really appreciate it. Thank you! ☺️"
"I never bothered to leave any reviews because I did not really have any issues with the app until now. Please REMOVE the annoying notifications of “people you may know”. I find notifications about people I may know extremely annoying and unnecessary. I don’t care about people I may know. I didn’t mind seeing the suggested people on the app but now I’m getting actual notifications about this and it’s really annoying. It’s always people I don’t know at all and there is no way to turn off these stupid notifications. I hate them, please remove these awful notifications or at least give us the option to turn them off because when I went to check to see if I can turn off this specific notification, there was no option to do so. The only notifications I’m interested in are notifications of likes and comments on my posts and when my friends send me direct messages and friend requests. Any other notifications I’m not interested in, but the other notifications at least have an option to turn them off. But these people you may know notifications are just annoying, useless and I have no option to turn them off. Please give us that option to turn these notifications off as I DO NOT want them! I’ll raise the number of stars once you provide the option to get rid of that annoying notification of people I may know."
"I’ve had this app for years - since 2011 with my personal account, then in 2014 with my book blog account, and 2021 with my writing account. My little bookstagram helped me connect with a community of readers, network with professionals, and even get my last 2 jobs. However, the insistence on algorithms, an influx of ads, and turning this platform into a Tik Tok wannabe has me debating if I should even keep it moving forward. I work in marketing and e-commerce, and I shouldn’t have to spend all my free time searching ways to market myself on an Instagram account that used to be fun. I have over 4K followers and can barely get 10 likes on my posts most days. I’ve put a lot of work into evolving my account over the years and trying to adjust to the changing times but I just can’t do it anymore. It’s time consuming and frustrating. I barely see things my friends and other bloggers post anymore. There’s no engagement - nothing. I’ve posted reels as per algorithm suggestions and get almost no insights, likes, or shares, and forget it if I take a day or two off from posting at all. You punish us for it. You’re only interested in competing with Tik Tok and boosting already popular influencers while leaving us little guys hanging and hidden. If I wanted to use a video dominated platform, I’d use one. Just let us post and hashtag our pictures and stop turning the space into an algorithm game that’s impossible to play let alone beat."
"This new update has rendered the app essentially unusable. Ever since it was bought by Facebook, the UI has tanked severely, and isn’t user friendly anymore. The new positions of the buttons do not make any sense, the posting mechanism is hidden along with stories and reels, the DM system is 10x worse (trying to swipe out of a conversation can sometimes make you reply to a specific message which is completely unnecessary and unused), and at this point, I see more advertisements than I do my friends posts. The only reason any of these updates happened was because 1. Instagram wanted to make more of a profit by changing out the “notifications” section with “shopping” (a feature that most people don’t use) in order to bump up traffic revenue and 2. They changed out the “new post” button with “reels” as a way to compete with Tiktok. No one wants to do their shopping on Instagram, and if we wanted to use Tiktok, we would. Everyone who has been posting to reels has just been reuploading their Tiktoks, not making any new content purely for reels. Thr worst part about all of this is that if you have multiple accounts, these updates might not be present on all of them. Some of my accounts have the full update, and some haven’t even begun to change, which is extremely confusing. This review is longer than expected, but that just shows how terrible this apps interface has gotten. Don’t update if you can avoid it."
"I have had a frustrating issue for several months now where certain features either make the app crash suddenly, or do not work entirely. One feature that does not work at all. Not a single time... is the ability to post multiple photos in a singular post. I’ve tried with just 2 photos. I’ve tried with the maximum amount of photos in a photoset(10). Not a single time has this worked. After adding a caption with some hashtags, tagging friends, and waiting for the post to load. It fails to post every single time. I’ve tried this on both my old phone iPhone 6S plus, as well as my most recent phone purchase the iPhone X. This feature has never worked for me, often times being so frustrated I’d neglect the app for a few days and then find myself back. After attempting to delete the app as well as the app cache and reinstalling on both phones the feature is still inoperative. I also agree with many other Instagram users that the feed is very annoying that I’ll see posts I’ve seen already, or posts from several days ago. Chronological order?? If Instagram was more oriented on creating a seamless working application they may have a lot more users, or more frequent users of the app. Every bug I’ve experienced, I’ve submitted through the in app report a bug."
"For months now I’ve had the same issue of not being able to view my liked picture and reels. Between me and the people I know who also use Instagram for iPhone, im the only one who doesn’t have the “settings>account>posts you’ve liked” setting anymore. And I was willing to let go viewing liked pictures because I found out that reels had an option to view liked reels, even if it was buggy. But now, neither option exists so liking pictures or reels is pointless. I basically have no reason to come back to this app because I can’t even go back and look at the art or tutorials I’ve liked/might want to use as a reference. 

I’ve also tried to contact whatever nonexistent customer service there is with no answer back whatsoever. Seriously, if you Google their customer service contact list, the only option is to report an issue through Instagram. There is no email, phone number, nothing actually useful that lets you know that your complaints or questions will be seen by a human being. Heaven forbid something good ever comes back to this app, such as the fixing of the broken algorithm that makes you view the same posts for weeks at a time. I’ve had to unfollow so many people because it was the only method to fixing the issue. Lazy, lousy excuse for “customer care.” Might as well go back to DeviantArt if you care about being an online artist in the modern day."
"First of I don’t like how if you have a really good quality picture instagram ruins the quality! THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED RIGHT AWAY! US POSTING A PICTURE SHOULDN'T RUIN THE QUALITY OF THE POST! Second I don’t like how some people’s instagrams have different stuff than others. Like how for some people their can choose to color their messages and some can’t. It’s really unfair to others that don’t even have the option. The same thing goes with the bouncing text letter thing. Some people are able to move the text and it like wiggles and stiff while others do not have that option. Also it took so long for everyone to get the option to be able to share a post to your story. I remember i went years without having the option to share posts to your story, even after i sent many reports to instagram about this. So of course I was super happy when I FINALLY had the option. I have no clue why it took them sooo long to fix that when so many people were reporting that. Anyway I hope this helps and I hope instagram gets faster at fixing their bugs and make sure everyone’s instagrams are fair. Like have the same options and stuff. That’s it for now! 0w0"
"Im in the same boat as many others here. I liked Instagram as it was different from other platforms. It’s essentially become a place to reshare tiktok videos and there’s no longer even a button on the toolbar to make a post.

There is NO customer service. My app has been glitched for SEVERAL updates and won’t allow me to share a post (even my own) to my stories. I report and hear nothing. I’ve removed the app from my phone and re download and same issue. The issue even stayed with me when I purchased a new phone! I get that there’s a huge user base, but seriously they can’t dedicate ANY energy to customer service for escalated issues?!? I’m a contractor and can no longer share the posts of my clients and partners - during a pandemic it looks even more to my clients that I’m not involved bc I can’t promote their content without taking a screenshot and creating my own post- it’s hurting my working relationships.

It’s gotten so bad that I barely use the app anymore. I don’t like Facebook SnapChat or TikTok and it’s clear that Instagram is just becoming like the others so there’s no point. I’m served adds and content I didn’t follow and am constantly missing out on important updates from people I actually care about - the whole point of the app allowing me to specifically target my experience is gone, and Instagram frankly doesn’t care about its users as they are all the product themselves."
"I follow several artists / content creators whose content is deemed “sensitive” by instagram. I know for a fact that most of these accounts never show up in my feed despite the fact that I’M FOLLOWING THEM. I’ve even gone thru certain pages and liked several posts at a time in an attempt to show the ig algorithm that I want to see the content that I follow. To make matters worse, now everyone is talking about this new sensitive content filter but I don’t have it available in my settings. I have updated, reinstalled and combed thru the app’s settings to no avail. So basically, IG refuses to show me the content that I follow. Instead, I am constantly having tiktoks and ads shoved down my throat. To make matters worse the only content they seem to deem “sensitive” is nudity, specifically any nudity that may be portrayed from a female perspective. Political propaganda and misinformation are NOT considered sensitive content apparently, so my explore page has no shortage of casual racism for me to pick through, not to mention all the fast fashion and ponzi schemes. It’s honestly pathetic how transparent instagram is. They only care about content that they will get paid to show you. They don’t care about “filtering sensitive content” and they definitely don’t care about preventing the spread of misinformation. I wish more than anything that an alternative to IG would become mainstream, this platform is seriously dead. You killed it. Congratulations."
"I love Instagram, it’s like a more modern version of Facebook thats basic enough for my grandma to understand but still fun for me to use. However I don’t know if this is a fluke or apart of the update. A message came up saying Instagram limits how much likes we can do on comments at a time to stop bullying... I just want to know who thought this was a good idea. This is a social media app that’s like the whole point, liking is literally the foundation of every media. If you have a limit whether your intentions are bad or not your going to end up being wiped for existence. And also I don’t know who thought a limit on liking comments would prevent bullying but that person has obviously never really been bullied in their entire life because that does nothing. The only thing limiting likes is going to do is leave Instagram with bad rating and have your audience delete the app and go to another platform that allows them to do what social media is suppose to be able to do. Speaking of such I won’t delete the app yet because I’m hoping this is a fluke but I will be switching to another platform, for the rest of the month, that is able to do its job. I appreciate the concern for bullying but find a way to help prevent it that doesn’t effect everyone and take away from the purpose of social media."
"Overall I love the app instagram, you can see funny videos and even gain followers on there, but here is the biggest problem on instagram, THEY ARE DELETING ACCOUNTS THAT DID NOTHING WRONG. Instagram needs to get out of their brain dead state and start checking accounts before deleting them because they are getting reported and accounts are being banned and disabled. This is especially unfair to the fan editors out there. There are hundreds of thousands of people who make edits of their favorite people on apps such as TikTok, Instagram, etc. These fans work hard on their edits, tag the people they edited, try to make their day by showing how much they love them just so instagram can delete the photos and videos because they assume that they are trying to be them??? Clearly if you read the caption you can clearly see that they are just simply showing how much they love that user. They are not trying to be like them they are just trying to support them. If they think people who show love to who they support then why don’t hate pages get banned, reported, or disabled? This isn’t the only people instagram has done this to because a nice dancer who did absolutely nothing wrong got disabled at 300k, the followers she worked hard on getting!!! Instagram needs to step up their game and stop doing all this bad stuff to these people who show their support or I’ll just have to be one of the many people who delete this app."
"Ive had multiple accounts since 2015 … I used to be addicted to social media … Now that I’m not I can see all the many things wrong with social media and especially this app … The shopping feature is dumb … The moving buttons around is dumb … Having only one account get an update when the other doesn’t, even though it’s the same app on the same phone, is dumb … I also really miss the layout where the profile pic was on the right and the followers number wasn’t big in everyone’s faces and the name and bio were bigger as well … That being said I do like that the views and likes can be hidden etc … The reels try too hard to be tiktok … The messages although I like different themes there aren’t enough interesting ones … The porn bot accounts are annoying .. Real people get their accounts taken down while all the bots just keep popping up … I just wish this app was about sharing pictures and 1 minute videos again … Stories are really extra .. privacy is just unheard of these days … It’s so annoying .. Also the comparing your life to others is very easy to do with this app … Anyway I already deleted it but you guys should too it’s not only annoying but it’s unhealthy. Get your real life back and stop worrying about what others are doing. Find yourself. Get a career. Be happy. Read a book or write one. Go outside. Get a job. Pick up some productive hobbies. Just detach from socials. It’s not real life."
"I finally decided to get on instagram after my friends would not stop asking me to get on. And it was not a good experience, why because my account was shut down before even seeing the home page or whatever the first thing you see when the app is open. Now I’ll will tell you exactly what I did. I went to my App Store downloaded instagram next I clicked create new account, I entered my email address and chose my password then click next, the next window 
Gave me the option to leave my email address as my instagram account name I didn’t so I changed it and then clicked next then the page glitched out and said that something went wrong and there was a button that said go back so I did that and I took me to the beginning to create an account so I entered my email clicked next and it said that this email already exists so I go to instagram app clicked on log in enter my email and password clicked log in and I get a message that my account was closed because I violated the terms and condition. I’ve actually tried again to create an account 2 days later using my work email and it did the same thing again. Idk what I’m doing wrong but I’m annoyed and done with instagram, that I’m just going to stick with Snapchat. Also don’t bother sending instagram a message because they are probably not going to reply back it’s been about 5 business days since I’ve sent them a message and still no reply."
"There is just so much commotion going on in this app its becoming sensory overload. Stop suggesting posts to me of the same bot accounts that post ""satisfying"" content and using the same abcdefu song every 3 videos. I click ""not interested"" and it really doesn't do anything but keep showing me the same content. I hope that the algorithm becomes better because it seems even though you hide likes and views, the only posts that get shown are the ones with a lot of interaction going on. I have 1k followers, and I get like 5 likes because my posts don't show up in the feed for majority of my followers. Please go back to chronological order rather than by whats trending, thats what the explore page is for. That goes for feed and for comment sections. I like to read comments, and comment myself, but the comments with the most likes get put first, or someone with a blue check, and it is randomized other than that. Youll see a comment from 3 weeks ago, and then scroll all the way down to see comments 3 minutes ago. Also, if i get a response to my comment in a thread, i can either click ""view new comments"" and it wont let me view all the previous, or vice versa. i have to manually go to the page and post and find my comment all the way in the messed up comment section to read all of the thread in order."
"I don't know who reviews the accounts and posts but they're definitely not doing their job right
They deleted many posts based on the amoung of reports it got with out actually reviewing the posts ( the posts you deleted i was defending people's rights in , the opposite of what it got reported for , and the people who reported those posts were the criminals i was defending the victims from , they just had the numbers and the posts "" you should've actually reviewed before you deleted"" were absolutely clean and didn't violate any rule ) and I reported this problem many times but got no reply, eventually they DELETED my account that had 70k followers ""again based on the amount of reports only"" without actually reviewing the account, i've been emailing you for months and still no reply I provided all the evidence you asked for and still no reply , who the f** is working there , are they blind? And my new account is being reported too , some posts got deleted for nudity, and it's just pictures of tha dam* nature at night , are you f** serious?! This is absurd, how on earth is night time nudity?! That's a clear proof that you act based on the amount of reports not actually reviewing and doing your job , I'm deleting this stupid app and Facebook and messenger, i might use it when they hire people who actually do their jobs , Twitter is so much better Sooooo much
Non of this nonsense happens with their app"
I literally don’t know what to do anymore. Someone’s pretending to be me I try filling in the form attached my ID I even tried through the computer and it’s saying they can’t “process my request”  I tried other ways to report it to them by reporting a specific photo cause the profile photo they have of me is the same at the photo they uploaded I sent the report EXPLAINING THAT THEIR FORM ISNT WORKING sending the photo so they can see and my photo to confirm that I’m the one in the photo.... they replied saying they can’t process my report cause I sent too many pictures they ask me to sent a picture of just me holding my Id. The only thing they did was take down the photo the fake account uploaded!!! They literally had one job... like don’t you see my ID has the same name of the account ? And the photo uploaded is the same as the profile picture? That makes no sense. I heard you can get an account deleted if you have about 15 people to report it... that didn’t work either... mind you I don’t even have a personal Instagram anymore I deleted it due to this person trying to do me harm... I have no idea what to do. I already tried reporting the issue “somethings not working” to them and after submitting it little 30 seconds after it says I need to tap to re try uploading my report cause it’s not going through... please can someone help me with this... I feel so unsafe !
"I have pretty much the same comments as everyone else, regarding bringing back chronological order of the feed, stories being a ripoff of Snapchat (but I believe Facebook, instagram, and Snapchat are all owned by the same company if I’m not mistaken), etc. BUT ALSO, I just bought an iPhone X and the app needs some serious revamping be compatible with the new phone. They did a good job of having the layout fill the full screen view of the X; HOWEVER, when you go to upload a new profile photo, if you click on any photo besides the very most recent one in your photo album, the layout glitches, and the “Cancel” and “Done” buttons move up on top of the iPhone’s time and battery displays. I wish I could attach a photo to this review, but I hope my explanation makes sense. This glitch makes it impossible to click either of the buttons, and you have to physically kill the app and reopen it in order to get out of the screen and back to using the app. This happens every time you try to change the profile photo. If you use the most recent photo in your album, it works mostly fine, with just a little awkward cropping on top. This is just frustrating because obviously people might want to be able to upload ANY of their pictures as a profile photo! This glitch really needs to be worked out ASAP"
"Seeing what my friends like is 80% of what I use this for. This has been my main social media, and was my favorite up until this new year. Probably moving to something else. How can people be so out of touch. You’ve slowly destroyed this app over the past few months. I’m not sure if Facebook bought you out but it sure seems like it.  This was a place you could really laugh with your friends and meet new people. But why not be snapchat? Why not be Facebook?  There popular right? This isn’t just about this recent update,  you’ve been deactivating “meme” pages for months and there’s a reason they get so many likes and followers. Because we enjoy them.  I don’t plan to be with you much longer. Maybe give us a useful function that’s not something snap already has, or just keep taking key features of your app out that’s a good course of action. Maybe if people want to hide all the “ig models” they like you can add a setting to hide just YOUR stuff from your followers “following activity”. The only logical reasoning is people want to hide what they like, give them the option to do that on there own. This seems to be in favor of the ig models, now all these new people can like because there wives/whoever won’t see. And we all lose a way of seeing things people with similar interests like.  Nobody wants to watch explore tiktoks, models, nba videos. I’m interested in more than what you feel like is “trending”"
"Ive been on instagram since it came out okay, I’ve been through all of the updates. I can deal with changes to layout, and bugs. What i can’t deal with is feeling like i am being thrown into what feels like a money making business. I understand you want to make money, but instagram originally was a platform to share photos and videos that’s it. I like to think of it as my digital journal, but now it feels like a task to even navigate and find posts that I genuinely want to see. Consider that maybe not everyone wants to be invaded with things to buy even if it is targeted to us, it is unecessary because if we truly need a product we know exactly where to get it without the need of Instagram invading our experience. Instead of cultivating posts you think I would like, leave it up to me the human to make those decisions. I like to think for myself. And what’s up with changing the chronological order of posts? What sense does it make to cycle in and out older posts from users. It is not useful, people like to feel in control. Instagram used to be a cool platform to literally EXPRESS and only that! You try too hard to fit in Instagram, stay original that was your best quality. Make changes and listen to your users, were the ones that keep you alive. We’ve got tired of apps before, don’t be the next one."
"I’ve been having Instagram for personal use for a long time, but since a couple of months ago, things started to go downhill FAST. 
First - Every single promotion I create in my business account says it’s approved, and still is not shown to ONE person. I’ve already checked every single thing that I could be doing wrong, but there’s absolutely nothing wrong. Great quality photo, right size, right content, insta page connected to the Facebook page, you name it. And that would’ve been ok, if it wasn’t for the drastic change in the algorithms, which have been showing my page to its followers every day less and less. The only way to get engagement is by paying them to run ads, and even when you do it, they do not work... such a disappointment! 
Second issue - someone created a fake account of my personal page and HAS BIKINI photos, promising pornographic videos as if it is me, and even though I’ve already reached out to Instagram MULTIPLE times, and have about 100 friends who have reported the fake account, after 2 months ITS STILL THERE! And following every single male in my personal account. The account uses the exact same profile photo & bio as mine, and has blocked me so I can’t see it. — but I can see it through my business account.
Instagram hasn’t responded to any of my attempts to fix things for months."
Good app  but please be careful with strangers who ask to follow you or to ask you out don’t say yes to them ever and don’t  give personal information about yourself or anything for that matter because there scammers and criminals or even worser then that who can bully you who go on social media pretending to be a good person when there not good  to elderly to ladies and to young girls and boys. Just stick to those you know only that are family members and close friends you can trust  and don’t accept total strangers as long as you all be safe on cyber network without getting bullied that all that matters to me. Please please please be safe on social media I don’t like cyber bullies  and some can  be  cyber hacker imposter impersonating you it happened to me so it can happen to you also when you least expect it.  These days cyber bullies cyber hackers are one step head of the police and it difficult for police to hunt down cyber bullies and cyber hackers that’s why I warn everyone have fun enjoy but also put your guard up not down if something happens to your account quickly report it  in to the company immediately and block  them they will do a proper investigation.
"Overall, Instagram is an excellent social media app. However, I have found a few flaws in the way Instagram looks. For example, the comments are not in chronological order;making them very confusing. I have found a similar problem in the feed algorithm. They are not in chronological order anymore. You will see a post from 2 weeks ago, and then a post from 2 DAYS ago. Next, there should be a bigger time frame for videos. You cab only have a video that is 1 minute long. I wanted to post a slime review, but the video was 2 minutes long so I had to do it in 2 separate videos even though all of the slimes came together. Finally, I think you should fix the messages. You can always see if someone has seen your direct message. This isn't exactly a problem, but I think there should be an option, in case someone does not want people to know when they have seen their messages. Please take these suggestions into consideration. I know I am not the only person complaining about these things. Other than those problems, I have only had good experiences with Instagram. It is very easy and fun to use. You can share pictures and videos with your community or even the world! All in all, Instagram is a fantastic app, but needs a few fixes."
"Instagram has let a hacker take my account, steal my identity, photos, and friends. A friend started posting a couple of pictures about Fortex trading, when I private messages them to say it was cool they told me that I should get with their mentor, and that it was really safe. After a couple of days they private messaged me saying “my mentor wants to give $500 to all of my followers” and asked me to change my email address in my personal settings. Not realizing that they were trying to hack me I did as they asked. After a couple of minutes I was logged out of my account and could not get back in. They were very pushy and what they were asking. Both my friend and I had private accounts. This happened December 7, 2021 and I’ve been trying to get my account back ever since.
After they took my account they then extended the exact same hack to my followers, and I can not even warn them. I made a report to Instagram and they are not doing anything about it, and I can’t contact Instagram to get help. Update: I finally got my account back. Instagram did recognize me as the original user of the account. I do not think that it should’ve gotten this far though. I should’ve been able to get my account back almost immediately and been able to report it to Instagram."
"I still can not comment on posts, tag anyone, or post content with captions on my page. I find it ridiculous that Instagram is leaving antisemitic posts up, but they are silencing pro Israel and Jewish creators and content. It is very clear where they stand. I am requesting that my account be relieved of any restrictions immediately. My content is not dangerous, my content is clean honest content condemning Antisemitism and posting the truth of what is happening in Israel from a person who actually lives there. There is no reason to remove any of my content or restrict my account. I receive death threats on a daily basis from pro Palestine accounts with millions of followers, and Instagram does nothing when I report it. I receive antisemitic comments on my posts and Instagram does nothing when I report it. Any time I report situations like these, I receive a message that states, “Instagram has a high volume of posts and is not able to look at your request”. Then why do they have the option to report harmful content if they “don’t have time to look at the reports”. They were able to find time to censor and restrict my account for no reason and with no notice! So it’s obvious that they pick and choose what and who to report. I am not the only Jewish/Israeli content creator that Instagram is silencing. It’s disgusting and it has to stop!"
"First of all, I’ve only been using Instagram for around 5 years —maybe less— but I’ve been noticing that update after update, the app has become harder to use, uncreative, and, dare I say, annoying. I don’t exactly understand why the “create post” button was replaced by the reels button; I get that it is probably to promote reels, but there are much better ways to do that, such as put it in the place where the “create post” button is right now, or put it in the drop-down menu in the profile section. I also feel the same way about the heart button moving, because as someone who never uses shopping on Instagram, I would much rather look at who liked my most recent post(s) rather than whatever shopping shows me. Secondly, Instagram needs to stop ripping off other social media apps; I don’t know if this is because it was bought out by Facebook, but Instagram took the biggest details of Snapchat, TikTok, and Facebook, and miraculously managed to find a way to meld them into their app. It’s obvious that Instagram’s company is taking these ideas so people would use their app more, but I feel like people would use the app if it was more unique. To be blunt, Instagram should stop trying to be something else; Instagram should just be Instagram."
"Just wanted to mention to those who are are concerned , that I stopped using Facebook because of the obtrusive nature of Facebook in the use of my data and exploiting it for purposes that I have not agreed to, nor would I... Instagram seemed like an option that was a platform made for users that enjoyed and appreciated each other’s photos and small bits of commentary versus Facebook‘s rabid feedback loop of everyone including strangers who would be able to comment, and so often disparagingly so, on your content. Instagram at the time, seemed like a mountain lake of peaceful interaction versus the stormy seas that Facebook and it’s deluge of content and ads had become. When I started using Instagram there were no ads pushed onto my feed… Now there are and not just a few, but regularly inserted into my stream that I follow. Some of these ads have products which according to the reviews, could be from companies that are less than reputable… So already it’s begun..Facebook in it’s march to monetize all aspects that it touches is now slowly but surely souring The Instagram platform with it ads and I’m sure eventually with other products that will supplant what Instagram originally was to be about… I will use it until I tire of this which could be sooner than later… We shall see."
"Truly I despise this app. I know for a fact I used to have an addiction to it. Wasted hours of my life. And for what, just to hate my reflection. Truly the moderators don’t care about what is shown. Much less of who is watching. First of all I know so many children with this app. 6,7,8,12 years of age. And what complains to I hear from them. “Oh my bf isn’t replying I hate him” this is the source of toxic people. And it gets worse because there are even more dangerous complaints I hear, “I’m so fat”, “oh my gosh I hate my genes why can’t I be pretty”. Ok you may not be everyone’s cup of tea but who is. This is main sources of Ed’s, mental toxicity, sadness, low self esteem, etc. and I know some may say it depends on how the user user this app. But it’s very hard to make the decision to delete it. But once I did it I felt like so much stress and self hatred and unproductivness was lifted of me. Truly deleting it was for the best, at least for me. And I now download it during the day maybe twice. And delete it. Gave my real friends my phone number and I try to stop caring about people life because they won’t save me. Most aren’t my real friends or most are celebrities who don’t give a crap about me. Although I can’t seem to fully let go of it. If u are thinking of starting with this app I recommend u control how you want to use it. Don’t let it become dangerous. And I hope parents aren’t letting their children use this either."
"Instagram’s idea of a “good user experience” is not making it a good time. Their great plan to make posts out of chronological order is where it starts, I suppose. It makes no sense that I can only see posts in my feed from people I interact with most—I don’t have time to scroll through my entire feed, but I pretty much only see about 20 of the accounts that I follow, no one outside those because I can’t “interact” with them. How will I interact with these if i cannot even see their posts? Regarding posts—Instagram is supposed to be a photo and video sharing app, and the quality is downright terrible. Photos are grainy, videos never load, the list goes on and on. I’m here to share my art, and seemingly, it gets more and more difficult to reach others of the trade. When I first started in 2015, more people could discover me. Now, no one can and it’s an absolute mess. If Instagram truly wanted to “improve user experience” it would. And it’s not, rather going for select posts the app *thinks* you’ll like. I can like a variety of things, so show them all to me. My experience with Instagram has gone down and it’s no longer enjoyable to use the app because of so many inconsistencies, not to mentions the countless times Instagram’s been down just this past month. Please take a moment to listen to your unhappy users.

hard to navigate with the new update."
"Instagram as a whole ever since I got it last summer has a been a great experience for me. I’ve been able to connect with my friends faster than I would’ve without it, and it’s a good thing to have when I’m bored and have nothing else to do. However, after having Instagram for many months I have discovered a couple of issues that are driving me nuts. First, on the home page once every so often the several most recent posts get mixed up in a seemingly RANDOM ORDER. I don’t like this at all because the post that gets moved to the top is most likely a post that I don’t want to see again for a while, like today that post is one that I don’t like at all and would rather not see AGAIN, and also because I someone who likes his home page posts to be precisely in CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER. Second, when an Instagram update comes around, the caption for it should say more than just fixing bugs and issues on Instagram, like what exactly that update is going to do with certain pages on the app and why. Please take the time to deal with these issues that I’ve stated above so that in the near future I’ll be able to confidently give Instagram a FIVE STAR RATING instead of a four star rating."
"So I went to go on my art account right. I go to check my activity and it says “we’re having trouble accessing your activity” and I was like ok maybe I need to refresh it. I did and nothing changed. So then I say ok I’m just going to post another piece of artwork when I go to post it, it wouldn’t post. I also tried refreshing it. It didn’t post. Eventually I was like ok maybe it’s my email. I went to go confirm my email and bam! Could not confirm my email I retried over and over again and nothing changed. I even tried turning my phone off and back on again even though I just got this iPhone 8 in December! When I tried it again after restarting my phone, it still didn’t work. So eventually I was like ok you know what, let me just log out and log back in. 
  I did that and what do you know, I COULDN'T GET BACK IN MY ACCOUNT AT ALL! It’s so hard trying to promote an account and get more people to follow along with your art and I had been building that account for over a year and a few months...all my hard work and dedication down the drain. And to put the topping on the cake, my personal account had also started messing up so eventually I just said you know what maybe I don’t need this app because clearly if I did they would fix things like this and prevent them from happening. So I might just not even try to have another account. I really don’t want to start all the way over again..."
I was just on an NFL post about the Jaguars defensive stats having a plain old argument that even though the Steele’s lost that doesn’t make the Jags a better team... that has nothing to do with my problem. The problem is I typed a response to a commenter during the argument of which I was blocked from posting saying that Instagram keeps certain “guidelines” for the community... some generic message I’d expect if i was trying to say something racist or sexist. But no. It was a simple argument about football that I was blocked from expressing my opinion on because it didn’t follow “guidelines”. The comment had no vulgar language and presented my argument in such a way that there was no degrading or demeaning connotation toward the would be recipient. TAKE NOTE: This comment was made on an NFL post and I was blocked from posting my opinion AGAINST the team the post was promoting.  This is not a singular or first occurrence as I’ve had this problem before with Instagram blocking me from posting comments that oppose the view(s) expresses within the correlating post.  I quite frankly find this ridiculous amongst the sea of comments I read through on posts from news publications such as Fox.  As long as you don’t disagree with the post you can same just about anything that isn’t immediately racist or sexist... but I can’t argue about football.  Fix this.
I’ve had Instagram ever since I was in middle school and used it all the time! Now I’m barely on it. My issues are for one the algorithm I feel like people tell you this all the time and you have yet to change it. It’s annoying how I’m always seeing the same people post & sometimes I’ll miss my friends post and end up seeing it like 3 days later like what sense does that make ? I thought Instagram was a way to connect with friends and see what they post and it’s like now I can’t even do that cause I barely see their post!!! My second problem is anytime I’m looking through comments it scrolls down by itself and I have to scroll all the way back up to what I was reading. Can y’all fix that cause it’s absolutely annoying can’t even finish reading a comment. Another problem I have is the shopping part of Instagram. I know for a fact I am not hitting that button EVER to shop it’s a useless button and stop popping up in my notifications about the shop stuff and lastly the reels get rid of it plain and simple that’s why there’s tiktok and I’m not using reels like I’m using tiktok. Instagram is a photo sharing app once you guys realize that again I think people will love it just like they did when they first Dowloaded it. Now you trying to be like all these other apps mixed in one and it’s annoying
"there was a time when instagram was useable, and even a good app. but the devs keep trying to add and change things just for the sake of changing things, rather than trying to actually improve the app. it all started with igtv, then reels, and even a shopping function that literally nobody asked for. and now the app is a claustrophobic, overwhelming mess of features that don’t even work properly bc the dev team is more concerned with adding or changing things than actually fixing the things that don’t work. they recently changed the story sharing feature into a clunky convoluted mess. you used to be able to share a post to ur story in as little as 3 taps. now u have to save the post, go to ur story, create a story post, look for the reshare sticker and hope u find it among all of the other things that have been added, and then scroll to find the post u want to share and select which slide. it is SO much less convenient and so many more steps to do the same thing that we could already do, another example of a feature that worked fine that they just HAD to change so they could say they did something. why not, i don’t know, fix the issue with saving reels or igtv posts? u can’t save them into folders unless ur viewing them in post mode, which as far as i’m aware u can’t toggle. i keep leaving feedback reports and it seems to do nothing. screw this app"
"I’ve been an Instagram user for a long time now and I really enjoy the app. Definitely my favorite social media platform. I, unlike most, really like Instagram stories and I love how you can save stuff without having to screenshot. My complaint however is my home feed. I’m tired of only seeing posts from 5 of the 200 people I follow. I wish there was a way to have it be in chronological order, but you can make it so that specific people do show up at the top of your feed. This may sound a little silly but it’s pretty embarrassing when you accidentally like and comment on a post from 5 days ago as if it was posted ten minutes ago. Really I don’t understand why Instagram is making all these frankly useless updates to the algorithm. Instead of that they should be cracking down on how the thumbnail (starter photo?) for a video has nothing to do with the video. Now that’s something that needs worked on. I feel that these algorithm changes only benefit the people exploiting Instagram and hurts regular users content intake. This is a little long so in short great app but please stop messing with my feed, or at least give me the option to change it back to the way it was if I so please."
"One day Instagram randomly logged me out of my account. I tried to log back in and all I get is “ sorry there is a problem with your request”. It has been like that for over a week. My account is not banned because I can log in on other peoples phones and I can even log in on my own phone under the google chrome browser. It’s clearly a problem with the app. I even had my brother try to login to his account on my app and it won’t even let him in and there is nothing wrong with his account. I have tried redownloading the app, turning my phone on and off, and even resetting my whole phone and nothing has helped. I have reached out to Instagram for help and no has responded and based on things I’ve read they never will. The lack of tech support for one of the biggest apps on the market is incredibly stupid. I have done research and there is several hundreds if not thousands of people dealing with this same issue and have been for years and are still stuck and Instagram refuses to look into it or respond to anyone and help them. It’s disgusting. I have come to the conclusion I will never be able to use this app again until Instagram decides to join the 21st century and actually have a tech support team where you can actually talk to someone about your app problems. It’s 2020, I cannot believe I have to deal with this."
"Honestly. If you would’ve asked me a little over a week ago I would’ve said, “ I love Instagram it’s the best social media app out there!” But , within this lovely week-ish. I’ve had my business account completely deleted with no explanation. Let’s add that it was AFTER I paid for a Instagram promotion and finished it. So they took my money, then deleted my account. I didn’t post anything more from the post that I put through promotion, just took the money and deleted it. And now after giving up on having my business go through Instagram I find today that I’ve also been logged out of my personal account, not deleted yet, but the account that I’ve had since I was in 6th grade. The account will not let me log in since I had an account that got blocked on this phone. So now I’m off of both business and personal accounts and being forced by Instagram to take an ig hiatus. I don’t understand why Instagram is targeting certain accounts through their apps, especially account holders that are physically paying them. So, please take a second to think about weather it’s worth it to run a business through Instagram with having the chance for it to be deleted with no exploration and no support from Instagram since none of their support outlets either connect you with someone or even work for what they say they do. Thanks for reading my annoyed ramble. I’m gonna go see if you can run a business through Twitter now."
Hey so I am a tattoo artist and I use Instagram basically to contact and find new clientele. Over the last two years with Instagram I have had amazing results. Unfortunately over the last week I've been having a lot of problems. Accounts that aren't following me and a lot of my followers aren't seeing my new posts they said I was always on there different hashtags they follow and now I'm not also my posts have drastically went down in likes and all my likes are from my followers no new accounts which is very different then the previous weeks and months . I also have been putting out way more content and it's better so my interactions and likes and followers should go up like they have been but for some reason all of the sudden no one is seeing me finding me and like I said even my followers keep telling me the can't see my posts. I love Instagram it's been an amazing platform to grow and literally is the a third of the reason I am successful and I can support my daughter and wife but I've had a huge drop recently and it's hurt my business and I'm sure it's an easy fix or there's a way to make it better or something but it definitely is upsetting at the moment.
"Hello! As an artist, Instagram has been a great way of reaching out as a creative to other creatives, and see a regular stream of artist’s content on my feed.

Unfortunately, with each update, I’ve been having a harder and harder time both reaching out and seeing other people’s posts. Especially with the latest one — now, my main feed cuts off at all unread posts, and gives me a curated stream of recommended posts, which isn’t what I look for on my main feed. I’m looking for the people I actually follow and want to see content of, even if it’s old content! Old posts are now on a separate page that I can only find if I reach the end of my unread feed, and they’re not even sorted by time posted. Popularity-based algorithms that try to predict what I want to see inevitably make it harder for small creatives to reach out to their communities, and only make viewers have even easier access to accounts that already are popular.

I greatly enjoy using Instagram, as a creative and as a user, because of the easy access to a feed of other artists that I am already following — I don’t have this easy access anymore. If I’m going to look for other accounts, I would rather it be on a different tab, not shoved in my face while I’m on my main feed."
"I know you guys don’t read these but I’ll write this anyway. Why the feed isn’t in chronological order is beyond idiotic at this point. No one needs the espn highlights from 3 days ago at the top of the feed list. Then as a fellow developer and finance manager of a company, I know facebook inc sells data to other tech company’s so they can find “look a likes” and such to target their markets better. But you guys have made it so obvious that you are just hoarding your users data to sell to the anyone willing to pay your prices. Like if someone tags a location in playa vista California, and the very next day gets sponsored ads in their feed for Apt’s in playa vista california. Hey cool it’s a business and you guys are great at it because the idea of your product is amazing. But every time one of these algorithm based add ins are included into your development the greatness of your product deteriorates. I deleted Facebook years ago because long before your political troubles it was glaringly obvious that the spirit of your product was dead. Facebook was no longer the cool party. Instagram is doing the same thing. At least give your users the option to choose. Most wont even care if they were given a choice (yes that was a matrix reference). But when most people speak of how gross social media can be. It’s not the users or content it’s how you guys choose to display it. I hope that you all could really do better because now it’s kinda trash."
"I’ve had Instagram since 2013, which is a very long time 😂 It’s definitely changed over the years. A few problems I’m facing now, however, include my explore page resetting (I’d have to exit the app & go back in to fix that), and not having sound when I try to upload a video on an extra account.
I also feel that a few of the features that used to be on there were so much better and easier to get to.
Archived Stories, for example. Whenever your story would disappear after the 24 hours ended, you’d get a notification saying how many people viewed it. Now, that’s not there anymore, and I have to go to my archived just to see who looked at my stories.
 Another thing is the hashtag following (or whatever it is 🤷‍♀️). For me personally, I’ve never used this. I tried it once and just thought it was annoying cause the posts would go on my feed, and I’d be thinking that I’m just following these accounts when I wasn’t. It really isn’t the greatest feature to me, as I could just go to my explore page and find the same posts.
Regardless of these minor things though, I still use Instagram pretty much every day. 😂 It’d just be nicer if these issues were resolved or taken into account by me writing this."
I just started a makeup account last week aside from my personal account and literally every other day Instagram blocks me from posting. Either I can’t write a comment one day or the next day I can’t even post my makeup looks. I just spent 26$ to promote my posts and every other day Instagram blocks my account for like breaking the Instagram guidelines but I’m literally just writing “check out my latest post to see how I did this look” I’ve had to wait 2 days to be able to post again because Instagram will just keep blocking me. But spammers are constantly following me and tagging me and they don’t do literally anything about that! But I get blocked for posting my makeup like every day. I’m so disappointed and angry with their constantly bothering me. Nobody emails me or messages me or gives me any explanation and my other account works fine. Might just have to start using Facebook again instead because Instagram is getting worse every single day. I see people posting like half nude photos which are suggestive and nothing happens but me taking pictures of my eye is apparently too much 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
"I honestly hate it, i hate the algorithm and everything.
The fact i could be following someone and their feed may be COMPLETELY different from mine, but because i’m following them, i’ll end up seeing what they like when i go the explore page. Even when I try my hardest to make sure my feed consist of art and such, the algorithm still manages to throw it off by showing me people (all of whom i really may not care about) due to maybe 1-3 people i decide to follow, that has a different taste than i do, so their feed somehow ends up intertwining with my explore page/my feed, and i end up seeing the people they follow and what they like (when i really don’t care). If I PERSONALLY decide to follow one individual, I don’t need a flood of other people popping up letting me know who that ONE individual is following and what they may like. I find that highly annoying.
I also miss when instagram videos used to loop, instead of having to constantly replay it, i miss how it used to loop a video. 
Navigating through instagram is becoming obnoxious and i cannot stand it. The algorithm on this site/app is HORRENDOUS!
It doesn’t give you a chance to really just FIND someone on accident like it used to. You’re kind of forced now, to have a circle of people that all follow each other (even when you’re completely uninterested). It’s annoying."
"Please hear me out Instagram because apparently you don’t deem your users worthy of your time. I’ve been blocked from commenting, liking, and requesting to follow for weeks now. Why? Apparently an algorithm considered me to be spam. Seriously? You block me from doing virtually anything on the app. And this go beyond just my interactions with other posts because I’ve been having issues uploading on my stories and I can’t even comment or like my own posts nor others which I’m tagged on. I’ve tried logging out and back in, uninstalling and reinstalling, and still no resolve. I’d like to know what the process is when you report issues because I’ve been sending out reports at least once a week for almost a month and I still haven’t heard back. Do you even check the reports? Was I reported as a spam account? What procedures are in place to verify a spam account? Why was I not a part of any of this? I don’t use Facebook, I don’t have Twitter, I don’t have Tik Tok, so Instagram has always been my favorite social media account but at this point I’m seriously considering shutting it down for good since I can’t even use it anymore. The only thing left that I hadn’t done up until this point is give a bad review and I’m torn about doing this because I understand everyone has a job and bugs happen, but this has drug on for too long. Fix this."
"My Instagram feed is now filled with posts from advertisers and accounts of which I don’t even follow. I never see my friends on my feed anymore unless I am scrolling for 10 minutes and people’s pictures are not getting as many likes. I can speak from experience because I have watched my likes go down as Instagram has changed their algorithm. People like things which are unique! Keep Instagram different and unique and make other platforms want to be like you, not you wanting to be like them. If the changes are based off of Statistics, realize the functions of other apps. Snapchat for instance, people like it simply because it is very private. On Instagram you are able to send pictures to people however they can be uploaded from the camera roll and used to look like the picture was taken just then.. this makes Instagram very user friendly for catfishes. Just keep the traditional Instagram aspects and forget about conformity. Make it so dm pictures- if uploaded from camera roll, it states that. Additionally, make the feed tendered to followers which a users look at most frequently.

Because of these issues with the algorithm, even though I used Instagram since 2012, I must say goodbye until changes are made :("
"I really enjoy using Instagram but I have one issue and that is that when I try to upload more than one photo into one post it crops my photos to the same size as the first one in the post. I want to be able to post all of them into one post and have all of the pictures be the original size. This would be great for photographers like me who go out on photoshoots and want to put up one post with their best photos. It is hard to do that when all of your photos are cropped the exact same way. It should be the same way as Facebook. I am not saying we make Instagram exactly like Facebook because they are two different social medias, but I think it would be nice if we could upload photos on Instagram the same way we can upload them on Facebook. With Facebook you have one post with multiple pictures that are all the original sizes. You can then click on them and look through them individually before exiting and going through the rest of your feed. Instagram should allow us to have the option to upload our photos like this. We should have an option to do this If we have a photography account. I know not everyone would want to upload their photos this way but many would choose to do this."
"I am finding it harder to use Instagram with every update. Changes that are being made are unnecessary and feel unnatural to me. I can’t see posts in chronological order, I have “suggestions” on the feed which I go to see ONLY what the people I’m following have been up to. That’s been slightly annoying, but now in the explore feed when I click on one post with the intention to scroll through all the posts suggested to me from various users... instead I’m met with only one users posts, most of which I’m not interested in and it’s annoying to have to go back and click the next picture to see the next meme or what-have-it, causing me to close the app and open FaceBook or Twitter instead as they aren’t making changes that are majorly affecting the way users browse content. I don’t know who instagram has put in charge of these updates, but every single update gets worse. ALSO not to mention, the app will automatically follow accounts that I have either never encountered or had no interest in following. I have never left a review in the AppStore but Instagram used to be my favorite social media outlet and now I’m much more fond of other things due to some of the updates and I think a lot of people might feel this way about the path instagram is taking."
"Instagram is going the way of Facebook, for obvious reasons. The majority of content they shove on my feed is useless to me, and I don’t enjoy scrolling through anymore. Not to mention the re-design isn’t even trying to pretend it’s doing anything other than making it harder for you to share photos— it just wants you to shop. Eventually they’ll make everyone’s feed 100% sponsored content and then they’ll wonder why no one uses the app anymore. I would say 80% of the people I know no longer use FaceBook and it might take a few years, but Instagram will be the same way. *Edit 12/21: This app has gotten worse since I wrote this. They’ve changed features like how to quickly silence a video - you can’t tap on it any more, that makes it fullscreen - no, you have to hit a 2px wide mute button that is not accessibility friendly and is impossible to hit. My note about sponsored content above has come true. I now see about 7 sponsored pieces of content between real posts. Just like Facebook, in a few years Instagram’s majority user base will be old people who spread misinformation. Gen Z wants little to do with Instagram and they are pushing millennials out with a very misguided plan to attract Gen Z that will never work. I’m a millennial and even I now spend most of my time on TikTok."
"Instagram has been fairly enjoyable for me…on my personal account. It’s an entirely different story for my business account. For the past couple of months, I have been unable to create promotions (it says something along the lines of “something went wrong on our end, please try again later”) unless I delete the app, redownload it, then create a promotion within 5 minutes of redownloading it (it has the old Instagram appearance with the notification section on the bottom bar when I redownload it, then changes back to the new layout with problems after about 5 minutes). Then when I get to make one using the above method, I can’t edit it or stop it if it’s not performing properly (which they aren’t anymore). I also cannot edit payment methods (same error message). My reach outside of direct marketing has also plummeted (videos that were consistently getting 4k+ views in less than an hour are now lucky to get over 300 in their lifetime). No matter how many times I report issues, nothing is resolved, and I can’t find any answers online or speak with a customer support agent (which is INSANE for any service that accepts money). For the part of the app where Instagram stands to make the most money, it seems to have the most issues. It’s just not great for business anymore."
"I’ve had an account for 5 years and in that 5 years I’ve never seen a single bit of support from Instagram for anyone. Artists in particular are constantly brushed to the side to make way for unerage girls shaking their backsides and guys doing stupid parkour tricks that we’ve seen a thousand times.
Recently I discovered that they AUTOMATICALLY put a sensitivity control on our accounts. The default is the “limited” option and it limits what “sensitive content” you see. There have been posts made about how to turn this off. Howeverr for some unknown reason, I cannot. I can’t even get an explaination as to why I’m being treated like a child. So I’m conveniently stuck on the limited option with no app update and no way to turn it off. I’m undeniably angry. 
To further this, Instagram, and Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, has also come out and said they will be turning more into TikTok than focusing on being a picture-sharing platform like they’ve always been. Mosseri posted a video on Twitter explaining this. So artists, once again, are being brushed aside and left in the dust so Instagram can try to be more like TikTok.
What I’m trying to say is if you are an artist or you want to share pictures, and you don’t have time to make Reels every single day to keep your head above water, do NOT get Instagram. I’m currently looking for alternatives because I’m sick of it."
"Hi, so I really love Instagram, but it might be nice to have a feature where you can disable your view of the like button (AKA you, as the person posting something, don’t have to see how many people like your post).  I struggle with a lot of perfectionism and social anxiety, and so I tend to hold a lot of my personal value in how many likes I get on a post I make.  It would just be nice to not have “how many people like this” be the reason I choose or don’t choose to post something, or have it become criteria for my self worth.  But, this isn’t to say that people can’t actually “like” my post.  They still could, it’s just that I wouldn’t be able to see it.

Also, it would be lovely to be able to disable the explore page of Instagram for certain times of the day.  I spend hours, and I mean HOURS, on the explore page avoiding and procrastinating my work.  I like having the app around on my Home Screen, I just would like to not feel like as soon as I open it I am going to waste the day scrolling.  I know the whole point of an app is to have people use it, but I think I would use it in a much healthier way if I had the option to place restrictions for myself within the app."
"Usually I love this app however ever since the few recent updates there are so many bugs. I don't mind the new layout changes as I can adapt, but as far as the bugs on this app - that I don't enjoy. Everytime I like a photo/post, it automatically unlikes immediately after (I have to retap the post a couple more times which can be annoying). The biggest issue for me now is I just got a brand new iPhone 12 Pro Max and the app completely refuses to show me push notifications. I've updated the phone settings multiple times and even changed the push notification settings within the Instagram app itself. No matter what I do, notifications just won't work. It's very annoying especially because this is a new phone and the previous issue I stated earlier (automatically unliking posts as soon as I tap the heart icon) persists on my brand new iPhone. Videos also pause about 5 seconds in, almost everytime I'm viewing a video it freezes. Looks like these problems are shared among many people as well, you'd think Instagram would fix it by now. Like I said I do enjoy this app and it allows me to do many things, but recently the app has just been so buggy it's unfortunate. I hope it gets resolved soon!"
"Instagram is supposed to be safe for what? Age 12 and up, right? Well it’s not. There are plenty of inappropriate accounts and sexual nudity which Instagram doesn’t remove. Instagram favors accounts with followers. Smaller accounts with nudes can be removed, but when it’s an account with 20k or more, they do nothing. So if you are a minor or a younger child, be careful. There are a lot of inappropriate images that when scrolling through insta will pop up. It’s not ur fault if they pop up either, it’s not like I search around for these accounts! Instagram isn’t safe for younger people. Really disappointed in you instagram👎🏻 I literally just saw an account come up with a post of the woman in bed completely naked(nothing on at all) in a sexual pose with just her nipples covered by the way she was laying on the covers. It makes me furious seeing posts like that, knowing that there are young boys on the app who are going to end up falling into a sexual fantasy. Even if that wasn’t an issue, the fact that that is allowed on the app is absurd and outright inappropriate. Our culture today is a mess! If you are a parent viewing this, I recommend you child to have a private account that you keep an eye on.  I personally enjoy posting on my account and keeping track of social events that happen in my life, but there is so much inappropriate posts that I come across all the time."
"Instagram is a great app that I use on a daily basis, I love it and i’ve had it multiple years, but there are some changes that would make this app go above and beyond that me, and many others, would appreciate. First off, after you post multiple pictures in one post, you should be able to delete some pictures out of the post without having to delete the whole post. This would make so many users more happy because there are countless times when you accidentally post one picture in a group of pictures that you don’t like, but you didn’t realize it in time and you already have many likes and comments so you don’t want to delete the whole post and you just stay stuck on what to do. Also, if you creators made a way to preview certain pictures on a private account that the creator of the account puts up that would be amazing! It’s difficult to tell who some people are sometimes when you are only able see their profile pic so if you were able to select a few pictures from camera roll to put up (no likes or comments involved) it would be a huge help.

 Thank you creators for the amazing app:) 
                                                            ~Kailee"
"This is the SECOND time I’ve had this issue. I am not able to repost other stories and I’ve tried EVERY strategy to fix this problem, but it does not seem to work. You would think this problem would be fixed by now because as it has come to my attention it’s not a small group of people suffering from this but instead A LARGE AMOUNT. I love Instagram but this small bug has really irritated me, because reposting and sharing posts to my story is important to me, especially in this time. 
I’m only 15 and I might sound naive but I can say that I am very, VERY disappointed that the company of Instagram, or whoever fixes these bugs has yet to fix this one. It is a big deal considering it is one of the MAIN features of this app and it can be fixed, I know it. SO, like any other bug, it needs to be fixed NOW!! Before everyone gets angry and starts to put negative ratings on this app. 
I’m rating this a four star because I have pity on the app itself. If it’s not going to be fixed and eventually ignored, I’ll just delete it and put my rating lower. I know Instagram will see this because there are others who’ve complained and have yet to be responded. 
Thank you. Stay safe."
"Made a great account and was gaining a lot of followers but only ended up having it for 6 days because Instagram banned it. I had 600 hundred followers and was averaging 100 followers gained a day. The first thing they did to my account was make it unable to comment but that was understandable I guess because I was commenting a lot. They then lifted this after one day. I started posting again and realized my hashtags didn’t work because now they shadow banned me because (and I’m guessing) they believed my account was a bot. This got me mad but my account was still thriving so I did not care. They than started deleting some of my post claiming it went against their guidelines which I read later on and saw that it didn’t.i also made a promotion with one of my vids and had no problems and the next time I tried doing it with the same vid They said it went against there ad policy. Yesterday at 9p.m I went to check how many followers I had before I went to sleep and saw that they had banned my account all together with no warnings what so ever. They didn’t give me a chance to do anything. Today I also realized every account on my phone is shadow banned and I cant create any accounts anymore so yea long story short Instagram screwed me over and is the worst social app to date. Thanks a lot
EDIT: I’m now logged out of Instagram and can’t sign in to any account or make a new one and I’m not banned on those accounts"
Ever since I started using reels and my platform grew a bit more my page has had unexplained issues and glitches. First I couldn’t edit my drafts in the app and would have to download them which decreases the quality of your video. Because the quality is now no longer as good the views go down. After this continued it then became so I couldn’t post cover photos to my reels and each time I did give my reels an aesthetically pleasing cover photo Instagram would remove it later. This too was frustrating. Finally the last straw was after posting a reel I began to get likes but even after several refreshes it said the video had 0 views. How can a video have likes with no views? I became so frustrated I deleted the app in order to hopefully refresh and restore it however doing this made things worse. Now my Instagram has for some reason reverted to the old version with the old discovery page and the old menu bar that has no reels viewing option or reels create option. So now I can’t create reels at all why??? I reached out to IG but instead of Recieving help I became shadow banned. Now this app is completely useless as I can no longer create my content for my page and business and I did nothing wrong nor did I violate any guidelines. I do not understand this but I can no longer try to use an app that clearly doesn’t want people like me on it.
"So usually I’d give Instagram 5 stars but considering that my account was disabled for the dumbest reasons I refuse to give it 5 stars. I had been leaving comments to people being hateful on other peoples posts and just because my comments had curse words or the word ugly in them they would get taken down and I was accused of hate towards others. Now I’m not going to deny my comments weren’t the nicest but I’ve literally gotten death threats from people and they still have their accounts and their comments still exist. So why is my account disabled yet they get to have theirs? Not to mention the ongoing issue of Instagram not having anyway to ACTUALLY help their customers. They don’t have a phone number or an email and they have people rely on the app. I can’t even try to appeal for my account or whatever it is and there’s no Instagram workers or people to help me. So I’m literally stuck here without and Instagram account and the possibility of it just being deleted without me being able to do anything about it. If anybody from Instagram sees this and wants to help that’s be wonderful and if you do see this maybe work on the apps terms because they’re garbage, and work on how customers can reach you cause this is the number one reason people don’t like Instagram. I’ve lost so much stuff all because I said curse words and the word ugly, really?"
"I love Instagram. I always have. It’s a really fun app to use, and I enjoy posting my photos to it. But lately, I’ve had many more complaints than positive notes. 
To start, Instagram’s inability to listen to the problems that its users have or try to fix them is incredibly frustrating. I was attempting to make a birthday post for a friend of mine; with a large number of photos selected and many tags. It took me well over forty-five minutes to make this post. It told me that my photos couldn’t post and that they would try again when they had a better connection. Naturally, I went to the internet, searching for a solution. I realized, after scrolling fairly far back in Reddit feeds, that this problem has been existing for over four years and Instagram has done nothing to fix it. One of the troubleshoot ideas a Redditor suggested was to log out and back into my account. When I did so, it deleted the post I was attempting to make and all of my drafts. The fact that this app can’t complete a basic function it was made to do- the creators chose the photo and tag limit, not the users- and then deletes the entirety of my work and my drafts is absurd and unwelcome. These problems have been existing for years, but Instagram gives no care. Sick of this."
"I’ve had instagram since I can honestly remember and I’ve always loved it. But recently I have started an art account and it was going smoothly the first probably 7 months until Instagram updated and now no one sees my posts. I’m not gaining followers because my posts aren’t recommended because IM NOT A BIG ACCOUNT. It honestly irks me to see how my hard work to draw and post almost every day is now basically all for nothing because everything is being handed to the bigger accounts. Smaller accounts are now butted to the side and ignored. There is almost no was of growing. I use hashtags, my story, and I posted regularly— yet my numbers still decreased with the new update. I feel like it is their way of saying “don’t promote? Don’t grow.” Sorry but not everyone is able to pay for that mess. I just wish everything was fair like it used to be. Why do big app developers always ruin something that was going so good? How can anyone else make it when they aren’t given the chances the bigger accounts once were given?

Please, backtrack and return it to how it used to be. I’ve had many other artists also complain and get discouraged because they feel the same way. It may seem like a problem only social media addicted teens would complain about but when you are trying to get out there and get known so that maybe you can have a career out of it, it’s a kick to the gut."
"Instagram is a terrible social media platform with a horrible community with horrible bugs and only makes itself worse. I cannot recommend this app to anyone. I would delete this app in a heartbeat if I didn't talk to so many people on this app. The app tries reinventing itself and only makes itself worse by doing so. The app chooses the remake things that work perfectly on the app and make it over complicated instead of fixing actual infuriating bugs in the app. If you leave the app halfway through a text, the part of the text will show up in the chat every time you open up that conversation for a day or two until it stops for no reason at all. The app also chooses to implement other features that don't need to be added like changes to the profile page and making it more likely to mis-tap and hit a story button when trying to go back from messages than before. It chooses to implement these kinds of features instead of ones I, personally would really like like a feature to read all story's or better privacy. It also infuriates me that they have not chosen to make and iPad app yet. They know they don't need to make this app better because many people have no choice but to use it, like me. Do not get this app and save yourself your own time and brain power trying to understand what they were thinking doing some of the things they do with this app."
"Okay so I absolutely LOVE Instagram. Recently I have noticed it is not loading all of the posts. I will go on Facebook and see a picture posted that states it is linked with Instagram but never see it on my Instagram feed.  Also when you refresh it will take some of them completely off of the feed instead of putting them towards the bottom.  Can you please fix it! This is causing people to not get any likes at all. My followers say they never see my pictures unless they search my profile. I keep seeing the same pictures over and over again. Some days I get half of the likes I normally do because people do not see my pictures. This is very frustrating. 

Another thing that is annoying is the adds that I don’t ask to see. They are very creepy because they relate to the things that I like but that’s not why I got instagram. It seems like this app is trying to copy every other social media app such as Snapchat and Facebook. 

I have been having this issues about loading pictures and my followers not seeing my stuff for about a year now. Can we please go back to the old instagram where everything was in chronological order?"
"Instagram has always been my favorite social media app, however, recently I have had VARIOUS problems due to malfunctions within the app. At the beginning of September 2018, I was logged out of my Instagram account for no reason at all. No big deal, I’ll just log myself back in, right? Wrong. Every time I tried to log in it said an error had occurred. I logged into my Instagram through the safari app to make sure my password was correct, and it allowed me to do so. Now knowing that I was using the correct password, I tried again to log into my account through the Instagram app itself. No luck, once again. I contacted Instagram through email and they said there was nothing they could do about the problem. It is now March of 2019 and the problem is still occurring. Instagram needs to fix this situation. Which according to Google, multiple people are facing similar issues as well. Please Instagram, fix these glitches within the app or help the people who are facing these problems. This is a very irritating problem and the Instagram Team just seems to push it to the side. This is not an efficient way to run a company."
"Instagram used to be great. Now it’s just another messy social media app. Instagram has always been my fav place to go when I wanted a dose of social media without all the drama. But unfortunately, Instagram has become nothing but a crap algorithm that makes it almost impossible for people to see your posts sometimes because their timelines are constantly getting flooded with irrelevant ads & posts from people they do not follow. One thing I hate the most about Instagram these days is that they are constantly promoting fake businesses who are only out to scam people out of their money. There has now been 3 times where I have placed orders (expensive orders) with businesses that were promoted to me through Instagram, all to be scammed out of my hard earned money. By the looks of their pages they look legit. Thousands to millions of followers. So you think it’s legit. But once you start digging into their followers and engagements you will soon realize that it’s all fake. You will not get your items you ordered. You will not get a real person to talk to. And you will most certainly not get a refund neither. Instagram should do a better job at looking into these “businesses” before promoting them on their app because if you’re someone like me, there’s only so much you can take before you say F THIS APP."
"This app used to be perfect for what it is, but now there are several things about it that are kind of ruining the app for me and making everything so much worse. First of all, reels. I wouldn’t mind reels as much if they had their own dedicated tab off to the side, but I don’t like the fact that I heard on the explore page. I can’t even look at memes around other people anymore without a stupid stripper appearing on my screen. You guys should really start blocking posts like that from showing up, there are little kids who go on this app. I get why you guys created reels, but they should not be in the explore page if they’re in the app. It makes scrolling through memes VERY uncomfortable. Also, I like how Instagram used to tell me when I’ve seen all my followers’ posts for the past two days. However, I do NOT like that I have to manually select an option in order to view older posts. It makes it a lot harder to find something funny I’ve seen earlier, or like a friend’s photo that I saw earlier put scrolled past. It’s a lot more useful than just having a bunch of random posts from accounts I’m not going to follow below the stuff on my feed. All in all, I like this app fine, there’s just some flaws that NEED to be fixed."
"Used to be an avid Instagram user, but since the change in post order Instagram doesn’t interest me anymore. I see too many posts that are days old from the same profiles and hardly ever see the profiles I want to, I usually have to go to the users profile to see their posts. I’m also extremely disappointed in the new explore tab, there has to be millions of posts from users out there but I see the same (maybe) 100 posts repeated throughout. I refresh often and try and click as many different photos as i can, and I still end up seeing repeats more repeats than new photos. I originally liked Instagram because of the simplicity in communicating and sharing with friends, but am now realizing I’d rather learn to communicate on another app, it’s not worth being a part of Instagram anymore when it only shows me what it thinks I want to see.😕
ALSO YOU HAVE DELETED SO MANY OF MY FAVORITE PROFILES because they “do not follow” your guidelines when they are not breaking rules. I see celebrities get away with posting nudes and inappropriate pictures everyday like Kim kardashian. I also have several spam nude pages that try to follow and harass me that I have to block and report. Please re-evaluate your guidelines because you are ruining influencers lives when you take their platforms away for breaking no rules. Please start implementing your guidelines on celebrities and stop hurting influencers."
"I’ve had Instagram for about six or seven years now and have no issues whatsoever until about a month ago and ongoing to now. My Instagram account was hacked and as a result of this “phishing” incident, Instagram “temporarily locked” my Instagram account. The email I signed up with, I no longer have access to, but have my Instagram password, my phone number that’s linked or the account, and have many ways to prove that this is my account. I’m thinking, with instagrams “professional team” they’ll be able to help me regain access to my account very easily. Except now, it’s been a month later and I have still received no help from any Facebook or Instagram contact email or website. I’ve loved Instagram forever and has always been a five star app for me, but the help system Instagram uses is flawed and needs tremendous work. I should be able to have my account back and Instagram should actually respond to the large amount of Instagram users like myself, who have been hacked as a result of phishing and are experiencing the same issues, with no help from such a big platform."
"1. Everything about the update is TERRIBLE the layout reels everything. 2. I don’t appreciate being censored and having posts removed for cussing. 3. Put posts back in chronological order, the algorithm is keeping small business from being seen even if I’m following them. 4. Get rid of the cross app messaging. 5. Idk what you did but somehow I’m not even seeing posts from pages I FOLLOW!! How do I follow 300+ accounts but only see posts from like the same 10 pages? Stop filtering out content from pages I follow. 6. I was posting on UltaBeutys page about products that have been severely damaging women’s hair and causing it to fall out. Now I’m blocked from making comments on any IG posts and they say if I feel this is wrong click to dispute and NOTHING happens. So you’re telling me people can get banned for no reason with no way to defend themselves and explain what happened? IG used to be a good platform but honestly it’s trash now.

PS break up w FB I’m not kid friendly, not trynna be, and don’t appreciate my comments being removed, and my account being threatened to be deleted cause I used some cuss words. I’m an adult make a separate app for kids then

PPS when you offer to dispute being reported ACTUALLY DO IT. I’ve tried to dispute so many times and just left in the dark. Never able to get ahold of customer service it’s just “you been reported f you good luck”"
"I run a platform with a big global community and our Instagram has a decent following, it grows at a reasonable pace and we now have over 100k followers. But, the constant changes and addition of new features tied to algorithmic shifts make it feel pointless as a user because every new feature demands more and more of your time. If you don’t use the new features, your engagement suffers greatly, which is absurd. I don’t believe in shadow banning either, so this is not a critique of that, I’m criticizing the real ways that Instagram has said that they prioritize new features in terms of user engagement algorithms. There are a lot of us out there who really just want this to be a photo sharing app, and don’t want to perform for the camera as if we’re some kind of fake reality star. The amount of time it takes to make a reel VS post a photo is staggering, and unreasonable. It’s frustrating to see our follower count grow, our mobile-based sales grow, but our engagement at 100k is lower than it was at 10k. Make it make sense? I get it: Instagram is free and I can leave whenever I want, but a lot of our community is there. We just want it to be possible to connect with people with the ease we had a couple years ago. Let us connect with each other without forcing the use of new features!"
"Been using this app for years now and there are so many unaddressed problems I see daily that is starting to get frustrating. The app still auto-refreshes making it so that you never see the post you were on ever again if you tab out and come back. I’ve lost so many good memes and posts thanks to this issue. You also can’t save reels into folders while in the reels tab either making it super annoying if you want to save it because you have to go to the reel’s profile page then manually look for it in the grid to save it. There is also the problem with bot accounts and spam accounts and because of the algorithm many pages are now posting images as 1 second videos making it look bad when posting it on your story because of the pre-made format for videos in your story and it’s really annoying seeing them reels. On top of this, clicking replies in the comments opens it 3 at a time starting from the most recent comment instead of starting from the beginning or opening it all at once which makes it so that you have to sit there spam clicking “more replies” to see all the replies. (it’s not like this on ad posts though which opens 3 at a time starting from the older comments) Pretty fun social media app but without any improvements to these long standing issues my rating will stay at 1 star."
"I love the communities on Instagram. I’ve pretty much been using it since it’s first release. It has changed quite a bit since then. Especially since it was bought out by Facebook. Fb has been making some changes here and there...adding tons of ads of course, changing the way posts are filtered for viewing. 1. I should be able to control the filter. If I want to see most active posts or newest posts. 2. There is a major bug where videos and posts are not loading/ going through at a decent rate. If anything at least create a way to see what our upload time is if I’m uploading a post or video rather than “this may take some time” or processing. I’ve heard from 95% of people who reached out to me they were having the same issues. Taking hours to upload short videos. Even sharing stories. Just yesterday it took 12 hours for a story that I shared from another account to load. I have an iPhone 12 Pro with the app always updated. This should not be an issue. I’ve been experiencing these problems for over 6 months now. It is a shame because this is such a great platform with a beautiful community. 3. When I want to view someone’s stories or watch an IG video it’s ALWAYS choppy and lagging. It’s actually driving me insane that the devs aren’t on top of this. What is the entire point of the app if the content can’t be loaded?"
"Been using Insta for about half my life now, I’d say peak Insta was somewhere between 17 and early 19.  These constant updates make it impossible to have a convenient to use social media app.  For every step forward you take like 9 backwards.
First off, the bottom of the screen did NOT need to be touched at all, and the fact that you put reels and the shop there make no sense when you proved that you could’ve just put them in the top right where the old stuff is.
Second, it feels like you change the UI every month.  It’s impossible to get used to navigating this app because how things work constantly change. Also, having the explore page seep into your main feed makes no sense.  I have several accounts but one of my smallest ones with 40ish people who constantly post so that there would ALWAYS be something on my feed has maybe 5 of them show up consistently and the rest lost to the aether or having their posts show up days later.
You’ve made it nearly impossible for smaller pages to grow because of algorithm shifts that just smother tiny accounts or accounts that don’t post multiple times a day, and you put a huge bias on accounts that already get a ton of engagement.  I never thought that after all this time I’d leave Insta, but these updates lately have been making me heavily consider it."
"Instagram works just fine I just would really like a option were you can search a date up in one of your Mughals messages to see past messages! maybe to get an old conversation or to get proof of something someone said to you that is not appropriate and should be taken seriously. Maybe you want to re-read messages? I would really like this update and I’m sure many others would too!! every time I try to go to a certain date it crashes and logs me out or I accidentally scroll out of the messages,, my phone shuts off too and I have to start all over again just to look at something from the past, I wanted to re-read one of me and my mutuals private messages! when me and them first met and compare them to now. You could add a fast scroller to scroll all the way to the top in under 10 minutes instead of having us scroll up just to lag and get crashed from the app! Or to accidentally scroll one way and for the messages to be gone. Maybe you could even put a “search for date..” bar right above mute messages/video calls? please take this idea into consideration."
"I installed Instagram because the app said you needed to be 12. I had it for a few months and eventually my posts totaled to about 80. I had taken pictures of holidays, trips, vacations, my family, and my dog. For a while, everything was fine and I loved the app, but then I made another slime account. I made this account and started using both of them. After a few days, I was asked to put in my age for some reason on my first account. The one with all my memories. I put it in and the age said I was 12. I then had to try to put in my age a few more times, but I put the same age in. I then was forced off of my first account. I clicked the button to save my pictures, but it didn’t work. I was so confused because the app said I needed to be 12, but I got an email saying I  had to be thirteen. The app said YOU NEED TO BE 12 NOT 13!!!  I was so mad and upset. All of my memories were gone and I couldn’t recover my photos.  This needs to be fixed and I want my photos back. 
Another problem with the app is that you can’t have more than 1 account with one email. I had to start using my family’s email with their permission so I could have 2 accounts. I don’t understand why you can’t have 2 accounts on one email. If o want 10 accounts, I will need 10 emails. That absurd. Can I pox’s have an explanation on this."
"I it enjoy Instagram, it is my favorite social  media app.  I love looking at other people's pictures and staying in touch with family members that are away.  It is a source for a lot of my creative inspiration and I love that aspect.  All the new tools that Instagram has incorporated into its app are so amazing and helpful. I look forward to the new features that they will one day include in the future.  One that I hope they include is the ability it add/edit postures once they have been uploaded.  This is something that I struggle with all the time, whenever I'm posting multiple pictures at a time using their sliding picture format, I cannot add onto, delete, or rearrange the order of these photos. I recently just uploaded a pair of two pictures to my page only later to realize that I forgot to add a third photo that I was planning to put.  I think it would be helpful if Instagram added an option to edit pictures in such a way that we are permitted to edit captions.  I do not wish to delete the whole post, but to simply add one more photo to my post.  Instagram please listen to this message for it will help my and several of my other friends who struggle with this same issue!"
"Instagram has been horrible. I try to contact them through the help forms almost on the daily because of bugs and glitches that still haven't been fixed. I first want to talk about the image quality. It is a KNOWN Issue and has been for a while now. It should have been fixed long time ago. Second is all the glitches. I cant even count the times I have reported the same things over and over again. With no help of response back. If you dont care about your consumers just say it. Ive had to even google help forms to try to resolve the issue and there are hundreds of people with the same issue as me.. and guess what? No help from Instagram. On the daily it kicks me out of my account, tells me to verify, and change my password. Ive changed my password 20 TIMES in 2 months. I dont know how much verification you need. Ive even linked a tumblr and facebook to my account. Like it’s frustrating. Then a new thing is the “try again later glitch” pops up every day and doesn’t let me see any of my followers list or other people’s follower list. I get action blocked when all I do is look at stories and posts! Like what? I might like a photo or two but nothing to get action blocked. At this point if you want to grow on a playform. Instagram isnt the place. They care more about the shop feature then actually people."
"So, Instagram is like pretty great, it’s my favorite social media platform. However I wish that the creators could make a few improvements and adjustments. 
First of all, I know that there’s a highlights section for your stories, but I wish there could be a folder to combine posts. For example, I have a drawing account and it would be nice if I could have a place in my account where I could combine posts from past months. D’ya know what I mean? I tried to screenshot all the posts from the past month, but it was just too much work. 
My second point is about stories. I know that y’all have added polls and “type something” features. What if you added another feature like those two but the responses were anonymous to the person who posted the story. Sometimes I wanna respond to one of my friends, but I feel embarrassed or insecure about my answer. This feature is not a necessity, nor a need, but it would attract a lot of attention to the youth, like me. Anyway, I believe that these pieces of feedback will liven up the app. Hopefully y’all add at least one of these in. Sorry for the long post, I had a lot to say, obviously."
I’ve gotten to the point where I’m in fear of liking people’s post because of the action block Instagram is throwing left and right my account got action blocked for a week I was like omg whatever I guess I’ll wait a week goes by the day the block is supposed to end I like someone’s picture to see if it is gone now nope Instagram says that I gave away my password when I never did and even if I did which I didint how will they be Able to follow and unfollow if I have an action block on I have a few other accounts and guess what 3/5 of those accounts are action blocked for a week as well just right now the 3rd one got action blocked because I followed 10 people back I waited an hour so I wouldn’t get action blocked but that didint seem to work because you guessed it I did end up getting action blocked fix this please your “tell us” button dosent seem to work and all the people complaining about this dosent seem to phase you at all because the way you are responding to this is by doing absolutely nothing why are we all scared of liking our favorite creators post? Because we get action blocked for what seems like 5 likes it’s that bad please fix this all I want to do post for my followers that’s it but I can’t because I got an action block for a week right after I spent a week waiting for my first action block to finish
"I have reported a problem of mine regarding my inbox not working multiple times over the PAST 4 MONTHS SINCE I HAD STRATED HAVING THIS PROBLEM. They have had i believe 2 updates since and yet STILL the problem has not been fixed. My app is up to date and the device I am using is an iphone 8+ with an ios that is also currently up to date. Whenever I check my dm inbox, nothing pops up like no conversations or group chats, although I have had conversations with other before. Nothing shows, and the only way I could pull up my dm’s with another person is to create a new message and select the person’s name. After exiting, the person’s @ is the only thing that shows up on screen and no one else’s. I’ve refreshed it multiple times but to no avail. In addition, everytime I exit instagram or go onto a different account, my inbox goes back to being empty as if I had never sent anyone a message before. This has not been an issue in any other account that I log in to. I have also searched for solutions on the internet and YES, there is quite a handful people on the internet who also are currently experiencing this problem and according to one of them, they have had this problem for around 4 months as well. Instagram has done NOTHING to solve it, although there are many people who are evidently experiencing the same difficulty."
"They will delete your account without any warning and it doesn’t matter if your content is good or bad. They don’t care how their users feel about the new algorithm updates. Don’t bother trying to make a complaint, no one will respond. Your content gets restricted or shadow banned depending on what you post or what hashtags you use. If you’re a conservative, don’t bother using this bias platform to voice your opinions, they will shut you down. You’ll see the same 20 people on your timeline regardless of how many 1000s you follow. Advertising is everywhere and can’t be avoided! Don’t post often? Consider your account deleted for not using it. The new algorithm makes you interact more with followers so that your content is seen but yet my likes continue to drop and more of my longtime followers have unfollowed me. When I message them to ask why they all said they didn’t unfollow me and thought I did. So not only does Instagram restrict accounts they don’t like or consider popular but will also remove some of your most active followers to keep your content from being seen. They act as if they are too good to be true but are really setting themselves up to less than MySpace in a few years.

I really suggest switching to Vero The True Social App! Been there a few months and I love it. Plus, they aren’t as strict as Instagram and you see content from all the people you follow."
"You guys need to start listening to your users. Everything on here is just so messed up, the whole algorithm thing is annoying, and the feed/comments should be in chronological order. I don’t want to see someone’s post from two weeks ago I want to see the posts that were posted an hour or two ago. Also it isn’t fair that only certain story stickers are available to everyone. Yes I get that when you release things to the public it take time for everyone to get it so that’s understandable but when only some stickers are released to certain people that’s when it becomes unfair. I want to be able to add links to my stories but I can’t because it’s not released to everyone or not everyone has gotten the update yet. Also some lgbtq+ post have been taken down and honestly that’s just not right what is so wrong with lgbtq+ is it effecting anyone personally? No, no it’s not. Also being a depression help account on instagram I find it really rude that you take down posts that talk about depression/anxiety/self harm, then give people lousy websites that that so called ‘help people’ with that stuff. Just leave the posts up so someone can hopefully find the post and give/get the person that posted it needed help that will actually help them. Instagram please just start listening to your users or Instagram is just going to become as dead as Facebook."
"These restaurant and bar owners pay the waiters and waitresses $2.40 an hour and their bartenders $5.25 an hour, the owners say they don’t have to pay minimum wage bc they get tips, a couple of years ago the owners started taking the servers credit card tips and placing them on the servers check, which means the tips r taxed on the paychecks, the servers r only allowed to bring cash tips home the night they work, we live in Myrtle Beach, SC, but this goes on in many places, so basically the owners don’t pay the servers anything, the servers just work for cash tips and the owners don’t pay anything, don’t feel bad for those owners that have been ripping off their employees for years, please research this and u will see how right I’am , and no benefits either for the servers, even have to pay for their own meals, if your lucky u might get 50% off certain items, would u work for $2.00 bucks an hour, and these r just not the small businesses, it’s also the Hilton, the Marriott, and others, feel bad for us, the workers, not the owners whom have taken advantage of the workers way before the Pandemic ever happened, thank u!"
"I have been threatened and harassed multiple times and every time I report it, it either magically doesn’t violate their policies or there isn’t anyone to assist me. But when I talk about ethnic cleansing, genocide, and apartheid—-issues that are very pressing and very much taking place currently—-they apparently violate their FB/IG policies. This type of oppression and censorship is not only morally wrong but also a violation of the constitution. We’ve seen Zuckerberg summoned multiple times for the amount of influence he possesses through these apps. But with that kind of influence comes responsibilities. These two apps have contributed to not only sprees of violet on public and private scales but also are one of the leading causes for ignorance and misinformation. Giving it a 1 star for not just all of things I’ve mentioned, but also because they glitch often and are have now become some kind of aliexpress. Listen if I want to old furniture from some sketchy person in my area or buy dresses from China, I’ll go directly to those websites. Why my timeline and newsfeed is littered with everything but my friends and family is beyond me. This is why the younger generation doesn’t want anything to do with these apps. The difference between Mark and Tom from MySpace is that, Tom doesn’t have blood on his hands and we (the millennials) actually respect him."
"I love Instagram and it helps me explore and find new things and communities but I don’t like that if someone follows me and if I follow back, they can automatically start a chat with me. With out giving me the option to click accept or decline. It’s bother some following a page I like but then the person starts to spam my messages without having me “Accept” them. On that note: I would love a “stop chatting” option. I accidentally clicked the accept button when cleaning my screen for someone and they keep messaging me non stop even after I told them I wish to no longer chat with them, and after I explained that I accepted them by mistake, they keep chatting with me. I don’t like how I have asked many people and they all told me that my only option is to block the person. I find that extreme to block someone over me accidentally clicking “Accept”. 

I would love those two things: 
•No automatic “Accept” to chats when both people follow each other 
•A “stop chatting” button so you can stop talking to people and you’ll have to Accept or Decline them all over again. (It’ll be great if it kept the chats also just in case of anything)"
"I love Instagram and I use it a lot every day to talk to friends but I decided I wanted to scroll back to March to find messages that are super important to me and it would hurt so bad if I didn’t have them. So I started at 9 am this morning accepting the fact it would take me forever since we talk a ton. At 1 pm, I accidentally swiped out of the chat and lost my place. It’s December and I had gotten all the way back to August. I decided to try again around 1/2 pm and at 8 pm I was a little further back in August but I was struggling a little bit because this was another day we talked a ton and this whole time Instagram was loading less messages than before and was taking forever to load. I got to one screen and it just wouldn’t load more messages. Then it finally booted me out and I lost my place again. I have spent all day scrolling for these messages and I barely even got halfway in 6 hours. Instagram I am begging you to add time stamps to messages where you can search for a month/date and it will automatically scroll. These messages are extremely important and I cannot lose them. 

please like this review to bump it if you agree you would like to see this added!!!"
"I’m so sick of the updates. I have multiple accounts and some and the updated tool tab where you have to go to your home feed to find your notifications and it’s awful. Luckily my main account doesn’t have this update on his somehow. However, Facebook and Instagram basically forced me to connect the two of them which I hate. If I don’t connect them I constantly have to go through these sets before opening messages etc. and now that I finally did it, Instagram took the liberty to update my birthday on my profile after getting it from Facebook abs I cannot change it remove it unless I do it on Facebook first. I have a much smaller circle on fb so I don’t mind more personal info on it but Instagram has a lot of people I don’t personally know and I chose to keep certain information about myself private but that’s no longer an option. I’m sure somewhere in the fine print of the update I “agreed” for them to share info between the two but that’s not the issue. The issue is them doing it at all. We all know you have to do the updates or these apps will make it impossible for you to navigate them until you’re forced to make the switch. Both Facebook and Instagram just constantly get worse and worse and all these new features and sharing do is make it harder to be in control of YOUR account."
"Instagram is a great creative app where I can stay in touch with friends and family. Posting my own photos I get to be creative, too. I have noticed though I seem to go through a lot of issues when using the app. 

I had been hacked and reported it immediately. When I got emails back on telling me what to do next, I knew they weren’t actually people just machines already programmed which made is much more frustrating. Instead of getting my account back they disabled it completely and I had to make a new one. Then once I made the new one after a while it would not let me log onto or make a new account with the phone I had. It allowed me to do this when I received my new iPhone.

Now I’m having issues just simply logging into my account AGAIN. It consistently says “we’re sorry, an error has occurred”. I have good WiFi and the strongest connection to internet I can get, even if I were on wife my cellular data is pretty good about being just as smooth like WiFi. I reported a problem, but there’s no actually person to communicate with which is just frustrating all over again and makes me feel like I’m running in CIRCLES. If instagram improved their support system then I believe no problems would ever occur to being with on the app...."
"I’ve been using Instagram since 2011 and these past couple years and months the changes are making it so horrible I don’t even want to use it anymore. Can’t see who viewed past stories, EVERYONE WANTS CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER BACK, randomly follows and unfollows accounts without permission, some people who I follow I never ever see their posts, they censor/delete so much art and posts that don’t violate the guidelines, yet they allow accounts and posts harassing and bullying others to stay up after they’re reported, now they’re pushing sponsoring posts so much that if you don’t pay $$$$ barely anyone following you sees it, because of them handing out “credit” to everyone every 2-3 posts on my feed is a sponsored post from someone I AM not following and doesn’t post anything relevant to what I’m interested in or frequently like, every 4-5 posts there’s an ad, ITS SPAM!!!!!! CONSTANTLY!!! in between stories there’s tons of ads, and they’re STILL making it so their users have to pay for their audience to even see their posts, asking us for more money as if they’re not making enough off many many ads. It’s exhausting, I’m so sick of thing I don’t care about being shoved in my face when I’m trying to keep up with artists, businesses & people I love. I can’t wait for a better app to come out because once it does ima delete this forever, maybe even before then. I’ve had it."
"I’ve had Instagram for over three years, and as time has moved on, the app got worse, I run an account that used to get over 100,000 views per post, but now that they changed the algorithms to benefit only advertisers (a very sneaky and Miley hungry move, like Facebook does) my posts will rarely get more than 5,000 views. Hundreds of other accounts and I work to make our posts show up on the explore page and build a community, but now all you can find on the explored page are irrelevant posts and ads. Also, I’m pretty sure everyone on Instagram had been begging for a chronological feed as long as Instagram has existed. Well we got an update to our feeds, but definitely not what we were hoping for. The December 27th update where you swipe sideways like a story to see your feed may have just ruined Instagram. It is so inconvenient to access the explore page, switch accounts, go to your profile, and post on your story. You can’t tap or swipe to switch stories without accidentally pulling up random stats you really don’t need to see, and it’s very difficult to do one handed, which is one of the things that made Instagram so easy and accessible. I know this update is taking me off Instagram, and I’m sure I’m not the only one leaving for good. Please Instagram, actually listen to your users when making an update and don’t pretend this is what we want."
"i’m sure instagram knows by now that a lot of people use their platform to share edits. there’s lots of editing accounts on instagram (i have 3). but as editors, we have lots of problems with your app. i’ll start with the biggest one, the percentage thing. where it says “this post is doing 80% better than your other posts.” since editors have gotten the instagram update, our views/likes have gone wayyyy down. and we believe it’s something to do with the rule that only a small percentage of our followers can see our posts. that is just so unfair. we spend hours/days at a time working on edits. they’re not easy to make. but we do it because we love to edit & we want to make our followers happy. editors work their butts off and deserve more than 5% or 7% of their followers to see them. problem 2. instagram quality. when we export our edits they’re in good quality. but when we post them the quality just goes down? that’s a huge letdown when you spend hours on an edit, just to post it and it has bad quality. problem 3. only 5 accounts? if anything there should be unlimited accounts. other editors & i probably want to create more than 5 accounts, because we like to edit more than 5 people! instagram, your app used to be a very good platform for editors, but you honestly need to fix your stuff.

"While I enjoy this app, I've been using it for 3 years, there are some recent issues that have been bothering me. All the updates have just been going downhill since the chronological order of your feed was removed. My feed is a mess of the same people over and over again with posts from many days ago because instagram thinks I want to see that stuff above everything else. The ""solution"" was to help you stay up to date with the posts you miss, but now I am missing more posts in my feed than before because of this system. I recommend making it an option in settings to turn on chronological order of your feed, it would make things so much easier. Another issue I have is that I recently noticed that the accounts you follow are no longer in chronological order either? There seems to be no organized way they are put in order, it's just like it was randomly thrown in there like that. This proves to be very difficult for me to find accounts I have recently followed as they no longer show up at the top of my followed box. I am following over 1,600 accounts so I have a very hard time remembering the name of an account I just followed. I just wanted to find one account and now it's lost in the many accounts I follow. Please make these changes, it would make the app so much easier to use."
"I love the opportunity to post multiple photos in one post! It’d be amazing if Instagram’s team could take into consideration of giving the option to edit the post, once it’s posted, and select a photo to delete that you no longer want. The only option available right now is to edit captions and add tags, or delete the whole post if you want to delete a photo. I can understand how this can be “biased” as to what people have actually liked the post for- but I don’t see any harm. I can see in editing the post and later ADDING photos onto it, that I understand how it can be biased. Whereas simply deleting a photo you changed your mind about or it’s with people you no longer have in your life - it’d be a shame to delete the WHOLE post if you have different photos on there that you actually love. For example, I added 3 photos to one post and was hesitant about one of the photos but I posted it anyway. Now, I keep looking back at it and realize I really don’t like it but I love the other 2 photos and don’t want to delete the whole post just for one photo. Just a thought that I’m hoping could at least interest the team."
"After a few years taking a break, being hacked out of there and other words, it’s a nice refreshing change that you made. However, it would be nice if I could get on and take over all of my sites. There are still a few that are hacked into and I can’t take control over like my Google’s and gadgets webpage which is my store or was, my Christine wolking account, and my mothers Francine wolking account. Otherwise I am trying to find my way around here but it’s a little hard to make a post. I would like to be able to make a post without making a picture but it’s very hard to find my way around here even with my experience on the Internet everything gets updated every day and changed so for us older people we’re a little confused or at least I am. I’m a psychic and I can’t predict my way around here. Thank you please help me get my way back into the sites. Is there a way to combine everything into one place and a group of followers into one side and all my friends and do one site? Please DM me at this address if that’s possible or not. Thank you"
"I’ve been an Instagram user since 2013 and I’ve always liked how easy it was to use. Now, with all the new updates it’s like a foreign app to me. I would suggest having the original buttons at the bottom, such as the home button, the explore button, to post button, the activity button, and the profile button. When it was like that, it was just easy to navigate. I absolutely dislike having the reels and the shopping buttons at the bottom. Personally it’s a waste of space because I rarely ever go on them. Also I don’t really like the zoom effect when clicking on posts, it just does not feel right. I understand why Instagram added the reels and the shopping, but maybe place them elsewhere for the users who don’t bother clicking on them or run a statistic to see how many users actually spend time clicking on the reels and the shop. Or it would be a cool idea to allow Instagram users to customize certain tabs on their home page. Like for example, giving users the option to move the activity button where they see fit to allow a more comfortable feel when using the app. 
Although I’m not currently pleased with the updates, I will still continue using the app and hope that the next update is easier to navigate through."
"Instagram has been completely messed up for me the past few days. The biggest problem is, every time I click on a notification (from within the app or from a push notification) it only opens the comment section on that post, not the actual post. So I will click on the notification, it shows me a bunch of comments, but there’s no way to see the post itself; I’ll forget what the notification is and never end up seeing the post. Even clicking on my own post from notifications if someone likes it does the same thing. Another thing is I keep getting notifications from the same post, sometimes hours later. Also, another horrible problem is if somebody sends me a post from a private account that I don’t follow, and then I start following that account, even after I get approved it still says in the dms “this is a private account follow them to see this message” so I don’t know what post was sent to me. Gets super annoying. Lastly, this one isn’t a huge deal but it still a weird glitch: sometimes when I open a video somebody sent in dms (from camera roll, not a post) the sound from that will keep playing on Instagram. Leaving the app and coming back doesn’t stop it, the only thing that stops it is closing the app in multitasking. Hope you guys are working on these issues, thanks"
"This is a fun app until you start actually having lots of friends/followers and Instagram blocks you from being able to do anything because you comment/type/read too fast. Or maybe it’s because you tag too many people or who really knows the reason why because Instagram is absolutely unclear on their rules and they don’t ever respond when you try to contact them through “help”.  I get that they have a problem with spam and bots, but that is their problem and they should find a better way of dealing with it other than blocking real people just trying to communicate with real followers/friends!  They could for instance, give a warning before actually blocking or perhaps put some type of timer or “speedometer” in the message box if they don’t want to allow users to type fast for some unknown reason.  They could have a way to prove that you’re a live person and go ahead and unblock you rather than just keeping you in instajail for days with no explanation.  It seems to me that in trying to block bots/spam they have become super user unfriendly!! Come on Instagram, get innovative and do better!!!"
"I enjoyed Instagram when my feed consisted of posts I was actually interested in. It was a nice app to simply spend time on, especially when my Discover page was similar to the posts I interacted with in my feed. However, the Reels and Shop features have been amplified, while the content within my own feed and the Discovery page seem to stray away from my interests. Many accounts that I follow have to take extra steps in order to show up in their followers' feed. This has made harder for small businesses, non-profits, and activists to spread important information about their cause or product. Simultaneously, their followers have to engage with their posts in a more intense manner. There isn't much reason to save and share a post on your story when you already liked and commented on said post. I understand it may be a way to accurately mold one's feed into the posts they seem to engage with more, but it seems is counterproductive when features such as Reels and Shop are constantly promoted and clutter one's Discovery page. I quite dislike how those elements are placed in the feature bar, while the posting option is located on the very top. I'm hoping instagram can prioritize what their audience wants, over corporate speculation on what we want."
"With all the updates that have been made in the last few years including (but not limited to) the shopping section now being on the toolbar, the reels, stories/Snapchat-esque messaging, only showing the most recent posts, and having them out of chronological order/put through it algorithm it makes me question what the purpose of the app even is anymore? Is it supposed to be Etsy? Snapchat? Facebook messenger lite? Tik tok? Having an app that works and has since 2013 is a perfectly fine thing. I don’t understand the need for constant updates, especially one that moves activity that is relevant to who you follow and your account out of the areas that are easy to see and access. When I go onto Instagram I want to see posts about people snd things I care about not the newest ad for something that I couldn’t afford if I became an Instagram influencer. The original purpose of the app was supposed to be to share photos of things that are important to you. Why would you deviate so much from something that has made the app so appealing and kept it relevant for so many years. If I wanted to have Etsy, tik tok, Snapchat, and Facebook features I would go to those apps. I know cornering the market in business is important but it’s redundant and seems desperate to make Instagram something it’s not."
"For starters, I don’t want “instagram - from the company that sold your data to Russians in an attempt to win the 2016 presidential election” (Muller report concluded this; So did Ocasio-Cortez’s questioning of Zuckerberg). Considering Instagrams heavy youth use, and the prevalence of being against corruption, this distance would be an obvious marketing point. I think one of the main reasons people use Instagram is because they prefer that diversity between apps; even though it’s owned by Facebook. Not to mention the fact that now, the DM’s look scarily similar to messenger. I have to ask exactly why? Users prefer differences between their apps. If they wanted a messenger-like experience, they’d get messenger. I’d greatly appreciate the app to not lose a significant amount of user support. Also, the algorithm has consistently failed us. If you could address and correct these problems before they become even more of an issue, that would be great. Facebook to most Instagram users, it leads a feeling of uncertainty and mistrust. Our data was sold to a foreign nation. That’s unacceptable. So saying “Instagram- from Facebook” while making substantial changes to the app; it’s quite concerning. The app was amazing before. Now? No. Not at all. If this wouldn’t have happened, you’d have five stars. Zuckerberg has destroyed facebooks reputation. It’s not too late for Instagram... yet."
"I’m not usually one to write reviews. However, today I am. I, my two sisters and my father all have Instagram. I have had it the longest. My two sisters recently got it and within a month BOTH of them have been hacked. One just moments ago. The other was logged out while she was on the app and was never able to get back in. She was forced to create an old account and has to tell people almost DAILY that she was hacked and to please unfollow the old account because the hacked is now messaging her followers. The sister that was just hacked today has sent out links saying “she made this for them”. I go to report my sisters accounts for being hacked for their safety and that option isn’t given. At this point I’m scared for not only my sisters safety but also my father AND myself. Instagram do better. Instead of rearranging your app appearance and trying to make your app look like other successful platforms, maybe you should focus on your app’s security for your users. This is honestly just proving your parent company’s scandal to be more truthful than you are letting on. 
Sincerely,
Disappointed 🙁"
"I can’t translate posts in a different language after this new update... which is annoying because how can I understand posts of friends in different countries who don’t speak the same language as me? I cant copy and paste the caption into google translate so there’s no way to understand what they’re saying. Please fix this, thanks.
Also, literally everyone wants you to switch back to chronological posts. Why don’t you listen to your users? The algorithms are so dumb, I’ve stopped seeing posts for some of my favorite accounts lately just because the algorithm doesn’t think I’ll like them. I’ll go find the account with posts that don’t show up in my feed and purposefully like and comment on all of their recent pictures, but still some posts from my favorite accounts don’t ever show up in my feed even if they post ALL the time. If I want to make sure I don’t miss certain posts then I turn on post notifications. But this algorithm is hella annoying and I miss when Instagram had the chronological feed. I know most everyone agrees with me, I mean cmon Instagram, it’s painfully obvious. At some point some other social media app is going to come along and you’ll be as irrelevant as Facebook. So why not try to please your users as best as you can instead of more and more people taking a break from insta??? Just asking the real questions here"
