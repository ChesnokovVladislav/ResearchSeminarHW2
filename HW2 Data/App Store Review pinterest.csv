Thank you for adding back pins section Thank you for adding a choice on auto replay on vids Thank you for blocking porn/spam followers Thank you for stopping the bullying through comment filters Thank you for limiting story pins my feed is now clear of them unless I was to look for them Thank you for giving options in searches Explore/shop/profile this helps a great deal in bypassing shop I personally don’t have any issues with ads because I don’t hit on them and I turn auto play off on vids so I never hear them Anyone can do this What I would still hope for a comeback is board searches not just profiles/pins finding just boards was so exciting for me quick and simple I didn’t have to search through people’s profile to see if they had anything worth following and some have a great deal of boards I also still hope for a comeback is each pin tells you how many times that pin has been saved by the public it let me know that that pin has a link and can be saved and not blocked I also would hope for a comeback is each pin tells me a person that pinned it so I can be excited about there idea and check that board they saved it too :) Everything else is going well loyal pinner since august 2012
"I’ve had this app, and an account, for 8-10 years, and it’s one of my favorite apps! What I love is: -There are tons of pins, covering vast topics, ideas, images, etc. -The boards are pretty easy to search -I can go into my profile, type in some general words, and find what I’m looking for nearly every time. What I don’t like is: -The app refreshes if you leave it to look at something (unless you have one pin up on your screen, then it mostly won’t refresh, except when it’s been too long), which causes you to lose the pin(s) you were looking at (I recall looking at a pin for a door that was flat, round (think a Hobbit-type door, but glass, not wood), and had panels of stained glass that rotated around the circle/away from the lock on the door when you cranked the door handle in order to open said door, and I can’t find it anywhere. I have tried to look and am out of ideas for how to search for it) -When you go to save a pin, the top 3 boards that come up are the most recent ones you’ve pinned to (it used to be that the app anticipated the top 1-3 boards most relevant to the pin you’re trying to pin in that moment) -I have a Screenshot board (that was something added by the app, as an automatic way to save pins when you screenshot them), and now the app doesn’t do it anymore, so I now have to go through all those pins and sort them into their relevant boards"
"I’ve been a fan of Pinterest for many years. I’ve seen the way the app has changed visually quite a few times. I loved it then and still do now. 

One thing I’d like to change is the way notifications look when I save or delete something. The banner that tells me that I’ve successfully saved a pin to a board, blocks a portion of the next pin that I’m currently looking at. It’s too large (a big white bar) and stays on the screen a bit longer than I would like. I’d like to see a more minimal design: thinner banner, smaller font, maybe less opaque, and disappears quickly. Perhaps it could just be a simple checkmark with the name of the board the pin was saved to. if I was a casual user who only saved a few pins at a time, it probably wouldn’t bother me so much. But I tend to fall into a rabbit hole of inspo and pin so many photos to different boards that the huge pop-up hinders the experience. It would be great if I could move through photo to photo more smoothly. 

It’s something super minimal, but I really don’t have an issue with anything else apart from this. When there are unexpected issues within the app, I find it’s pretty easy to get around the problem and it gets resolved fairly quickly by the team (very good job on that part). It’s just this banner thing that’s not up to me to change and it’s something I encounter every time I’m on Pinterest."
"I love Pinterest, I have for a while now. However, they constantly are changing their formatting & the way it’s set up. Sometimes it’s for the better; I loved when they added the sections to boards as this made it way easier to organize pins, boards, & keep track of it all. But it’s not always a good thing. Recently they updated it & got rid of the A-Z on my home page which can make it a pain if you want to pin something in the lower end of the alphabet & have a lot of boards. Or if you want to look at a board without searching the board specifically (sometimes I may forget what I titled a board) & just want to look under Q because I know I have it under a board for quotes for example. So my point is the changes they make aren’t always positive. And even if you’re like me & use Pinterest a lot it’s hard to keep up with the “new” way of doing things & set up they may have changed it to. Kinda like if someone constantly keeps giving you an updated phone, you’ll figure it sure, but if they give you one all the time it gets annoying as you’re trying to keep up with how does it function now? I mean way too constant. There may be features you really like that they do away with completely & that may ultimately make you use it less. Stop it Pinterest team. I know you’re working on improving it, & that’s great, but don’t fix what isn’t broken."
"I love Pinterest but if you’re going to update the app and give me options of things to do, don’t take it away! I used to be able to like pins if I didn’t have a board to put it in. I can “react” to certain pictures but I can only use one reactions option and it’s not for all pins. So now I have a bunch of pointless boards so I can still see things that I like. I loved having the option of sections in boards because if I have a “house work” board I can do a section with the bathroom, the bedroom, the living room, etc. It was a while since I updated and when I finally did, I wish I hadn't. I went to create sections for my travel board based on places to make it easier to plan my own trips and I can’t! I’m actually mad about this. And something that isn’t really a major issue but kinda disappointing is that when I come across a pin that I like and want to see more of, I tap on it. But sometimes it’s just an add and it takes me to a website. Which I guess I can see more by going through the website but I can usually access the website if I voluntarily tap on the picture after getting a preview. This is also the only app that closes out on me. I know it’s a free app and it takes a while to give the app its full potential but this isn’t really a new app anymore. Keep updates!!! When you bring in a new feature, don’t take it away from us! Some of us are (more like were) using those"
"So I have had the Pinterest app for about four or five years. For a while everything was good, everything worked and I didn’t have many problems. However, recently a problem has popped up that seems unable to be fixed. I am unable to follow anybody, I can unfollow people but for some reason when I go into somebody’s profile and hit the follow button it lights up and tells me that I am unable to follow the person. But when I hit the back button and go back in I am not following them anymore. 

Contacting Pinterest support proved to be a hassle as I either got a bit or a supposedly real person that was talking about issues on my pins that had nothing to do with the original problem at all. I even tried all the tips given, deleting app cache didn’t work, unfollowing pins and boards did not work and uninstalling and then reinstalling the app did not work. I was honestly about to just give up when I finally got a real person and they said that they were working on it and that it would take a while. I have not heard anything back since and even after multiple app updates the problem is still there.

So yes Pinterest has a ton of pins and stuff but when you encounter an actual problem it is almost not worth it to try and contact support because either you get an unhelpful bot that gives you tips you already did. Very rarely do you get somebody real, it took me ten tries to get a real person"
"Ive been using Pinterest for about 6 years (off and on). Back when I first started using it me and my mom would find birthday party ideas and things like that but as Ive grown I continued to use it to feed into my current interests. I have been using it to find references for my fan art drawings and used to be able to comment under the pin with photos and videos and share what I created using the pin. It was one of my favorite features of the app and as a teenager that doesn’t use any other social media, I’m disappointed in the numerous updates that have taken away the actual fun out of the app. This is an issue because the app is about inspiration and using other people’s ideas to better your own. But if you can’t show how the idea actually turned out then your less likely to try it. Therefore leading to boredom of the app. I’m not sure the reason this feature was taken away but I do know that it was a big mistake. I hope they put it back in the next update and maybe the A-Z sorter for pins would be nice too? Like how many things are they going to take away- well anyways Pinterest is a great app for sharing your ideas and your creations and if you enjoy that kind of stuff try it that’s why I gave 4 stars. But to Pinterest please stop taking features away so you can add others it gets frustrating when you like something and it’s snatched away from you for no reason."
"Like the title says, I absolutely loved the old Pinterest. The update last year maybe made it a whole lot harder to navigate. I was accustomed to searching for boards so that I could easily follow other people who shared my very specific interests, but now that option has been gone for months! I’ve been meaning to write this review since then, but this newest update from a few days ago expedited it. Another of my main issues is the shopping aspect. In the older versions, it was more geared to crafting/diy/budget ideas. Now, I search for something simple like knitting ideas, and all I get back are shopping suggestions and priced items for sale. And there’s even a shopping section! I understand the need to evolve and bring in new demographics, but I feel that a lot of Pinterest’s original draw and identity has disappeared. Now, it behaves more like an Instagram or Facebook feed, filled with advertisements and shopping. It’s very disappointing to me that Pinterest has become so much like all the other dime-a-dozen social media apps and sites, since I initially fell in love with it years before because it avoided that world I hated. It felt quiet, calm, secluded, like a library or a yarn store, and I could do my own thing with topics I loved across the “board.” I am really, really bummed about all the changes and am considering deleting, which would be a major change. Please, please bring back some of the original features!"
"So I love love Pinterest and I always have!!  But I recently got the iPhone 10 max and now it just constantly freezes up when I’m on Pinterest for a while and my phone doesn’t do this on ANY other app or any other time. So I have no idea why it keeps doing this... but it is pretty aggravating. 

Other than that though this app is the GREATEST!! I come here for- it used to be just for like crafts and food, but now I have come to use it for makeup ideas, for like if I have a khaki jacket and I want to see what other looks and styles and colors may go with it (that matches what I may have in my closet) I go on here for an idea of what the possibilities are to wear with it. I recently used it to find out what kinds of dresses and outfits to wear to a Christmas party.. so you can get ideas and picture yourself in the clothes, you can have a idea of what you’re looking for locally. And of course this is where I go for beautiful quotes to add on Instagram. Or funny memes even to describe super specific situations 😂 you can use Pinterest to find basically anything! Gift ideas, crafts, DIY, recipes, home decor ideas, outfit ideas, makeup tutorials, if you want a hair cut and you are looking for different styles... like you name it and they have it! Oh yea and Starbucks drinks to try!! That’s my favorite!"
"I’ve been a regular pinterest user for almost a decade now. I rarely have a day where I don’t check my Pinterest. I mainly use it to curate aesthetics and find inspiration for my life. It’s very soothing and artistic to me, and the only social media I’ll use. However, I feel as though Pinterest has recently gone down hill. There’s an overwhelming amount of ads. To the point of every other pin is an ad. Most of them are irrelevant to me and my feed is no longer aesthetically pleasing, just full of junk. And I’m not opposed to tasteful ads- I’ve even bought multiple products advertised to me on Pinterest that had beautiful ads that matched my interest and weren’t overwhelming. But there’s just too many now and too many pointless ones. It makes Pinterest significantly less enjoyable. I also don’t understand why Pinterest no longer shows you who pinned the pins in your feed, and when you click in you can’t click on the original user who pinned. It’s totally confusing and counterintuitive- I keep trying to click the icons of people to view their profile but I can’t. The best way for me to do it is to scroll through the hundreds of people I follow to find them. It’s a huge pain. Please make peoples profiles clickable from their pins like they used to be. I’m satisfied with most of the other features of this app and glad to be a part of the community!"
"I’ve never made a review before because I didn’t care enough to before. But I have so much dedication to Pinterest, my issues with the updates have begun affecting my attitude for the app. I’ve been on Pinterest for probably a decade and no update has me more upset than the constant refreshing of the home page. I use all the platforms so I know that if you change from the home feed to your profile or to the search tab back to the home feed, the home feed automatically refreshes... when I even open the app sometimes I see a pin right away that I’d pin but for some reason it refreshes!! This is so irritating. Please fix this to wear it only updates the Home Screen if you pull down the feed from the top for a second. Like Twitter. You can’t even scroll through the feed sometimes without it randomly updating. Also the ads Pinterest.. come on. They’re every third pin! I get you have to pay the bills but more often than not your ads are irrelevant  to my search. Speaking of searching, why is it that when I search one thing my home feed will suddenly be filled with that one search? I didn’t follow the topic, I didn’t follow a new board, I don’t care to see it on the home feed I have sort of curated myself. This has been a lot of complaints and my rating is low so that you get how irritated I am. But any other time you’d get a 5/5. I love you Pinterest, rarely change."
"Pinterest is pretty good unless something isn't working right, but just try to tell them something is wrong if it doesn't happen to be one of the very few problems they've decided to list on their help page.  Apparently, Pinterest thinks everything is perfect and any difficulties are user problems because the available options are only about how to use it right.  There seems to be no email address, etc. to which to send problems that they don't want to hear about.  Well, too bad.  Here's a maddening problem:
If you are viewing anything that has to do with Taste of Home recipes after a minute or so a T of H ad will appear on the left and a larger one on the right.  Together these block out a significant part of the screen. (I'm using an iPad 2 Air with iPadOS 14.2). You can close the ad on the left by touching the X in the upper right hand corner and it goes away completely.  However, the larger one on the right simply turns off the ad and leaves a big white rectangle where the ad used to be, which continues to obliterate the same amount of the page as the ad did.  There's no way to get rid of the white box.  This does appear to be a problem with the app since the ads don't even appear on the T of H web page.  Drives me crazy...almost as crazy as not being able to find a way to report the problem!"
Thanks to Pinterest I can express myself throughout creativity and just art boards and just all these boards that I can make and I can express myself through them I think my favorite two boards is probably my Jesus Christ one and my photography because those are two really important things in my life and this is a really great app for all ages and I do recommend it to anyone who is eligible to have it. And I first got it when I was about 11 and I just got an iPod not a phone but my parents wouldn’t let me have any kind of social media so this was kind of like a social media for me and I very much enjoyed it you can fine inappropriate things on there if you search them up I have never search them up but if you click on the wrong link or something it could lead to something so just be mindful when you have your kids on there it will ask you of like things that you’re interested in just make sure that you are looking over that because there are things on there that maybe you should look over with them other than that it’s an excellent app and in less you’re truly searching for something or you just click the wrong link you won’t find anything bad and I truly absolutely for the very last time do you recommend it to all thanks!
"I’ve loved Pinterest since a friend got me onto it, it’s perfect for my writing work and image references. I’ve stuck it out through the rough patches cause it’s just that handy. Small things here and there I can live with, but the most recent update has got things going pretty screwy and making it hard to use the mobile app. 

The most recent update took away the side-scrolling alphabet letter list on the board selection. I have A LOT of boards spread across TWO accounts, and I tend to move very fast when I get on a spree. And when I say a lot, I mean I’ve tapped out at the original board count before and i just keep going up! So you can imagine how time-consuming it is to have to manually scroll through Ever. Single. Board. to find the one I want to pin to. Please bring that back. 

Also, on the mobile app, the board selection tab while pinning is slippery AF. It’s so incredibly difficult to manually scroll cause the list keeps trying to slide itself closed at the bottom when I scroll up. If I’m trying to access boards not already in the top three selection, just throw the whole list open and keep it in place until the user closes it themselves, don’t let it go trying to close at it scrolls up or not open all the way when I’m trying to scroll down."
"I used to love Pinterest. As a baker and writer I loved looking through so many recipes and and different posts. I still love the format and everything about the app. But I have tried to post my opinions in the comments, no bad language or anything and Pinterest won’t let me. People are constantly swearing and typing inappropriate stuff but I can’t post my own opinions. I will keep Pinterest because of my hobbies, but it if uncalled for to not allow someone to post something they want or believe in. People are constantly voicing their own opinions but I can’t. It is not up to you to tell me what I can and can’t say, I understand that it is not totally designed for voicing your opinions but if you have a comment section, allow people to say what they want. Just fix the problem more social media platforms are falling into, you can’t stifle everyones voice, it’s not right. Pinterest is an amazing app for anything else, bakers, crafters, and writers or anyone else with hobbies should really enjoy the app. Thank you Pinterest for fueling my imagination and crafting, for years and hopefully more years to come. Just fix the one issue and it will be a five star app, and Pinterest will be unique from everywhere else people go for crafts and posts and whatever hobbies they are into."
"I think I've reached the end of Pinterest! I keep seeing the same content over and over again. I only follow around 3000 people's Ms follow more every week. I have 9000 followers--which my number of followers slowed down significantly when they changed the feeds and algorithms. I can no longer see the people who follow me--even though my number of followers go up, it's no longer adding profiles to the followers section. I am so sick of seeing advertisements and sponsored content that have NOTHING to do with anything that I would ever want to see from Home Depot (I think we all kinda know about Home Depot at this point) to Pantene hair commercials. The settings for automatic video play do not work. And dare I use the ""show me more like this button""; CLEARLY Pinterest's taste level has a bug since it usually looks NOTHING like what I've just pinned. I preferred the only method of see who else has pinned this pinned so that you could start following others with your same taste level and subject matter. Pinterest has become almost as bad as Houzz for the masses and has become very hard to curate sophisticated collections of idea boards. I use Pinterest to work with my clients and promote my business. There are very few settings that you can change and I am so tired of seeing the same content over and over again! Oh wait, I already said that--well now you know how it feels!"
"I’ve used Pinterest for years and love the ability to be able find ideas & inspiration! I mainly use the mobile version of Pinterest because of how smooth and effortless it is (along with the fact I’m always on my phone!) and I find that just searching for terms doesn’t yield varied results, so about 90% of my time I search things and select “view by board” to browse the collections other people have made! Being able to see other people’s “finds” or their own uploads is a perfect way to fill up my own boards. If I wanted to search for a certain aesthetic or look for certain types of recipes for example, how else would I find good boards to follow so that I can see their posts in my feed? However, when I last updated it, the feature that allowed us to search by board on mobile is gone!! I can’t even hit a picture and be able to trace it to the boards it shows up on. All the pins on my main feed I can’t even see where they came from. I expand my results not by hoping Pinterest’s own algorithms pick up what they think I want to see, but by what boards and pinners I follow!! Please bring this back! The fun of Pinterest is in cultivating all kinds of resources or pictures in one place, what good is that if I can’t even have the option to view the ones others have made?"
"The Sponsored Pins are out of control. I see sponsored content more than I see my own friend’s post (and I mean face-to-face friends). On multiple occasions the sponsored posts have opened without any intentional interaction on my part; just from my scrolling through the app or when searching for something. But I have to put an effort just to see what an individual friend’s personal activity/recent pins. I feel like a creep. And now I’m getting told “Hire an interior designer from [sponsor]” when I’m just tryna look at a bookcase! That’s too far. 
I’ve been on Pinterest since it’s was invite only and now it’s overcrowded with multi-level marketing schemes and aggressive sponsored ads posing as real pins. I miss seeing my REAL life friend’s posts, not just what some AI algorithm thinks I want. And what’s up with the pop-up asking “did you find what you were looking for?”, why do you need an answer when I don’t even know what I was looking for? It’s just as uncomfortable as having a sales associate invading your personal space and following you around the store tryna make a sale sell when you’re just trying look around. That behavior is what keeps people from making a purchase or coming back again. 

Now I’m concerned with how my data is being used. Don’t pull a Facebook Pinterest, I’d hate to see you go down like them and lose the trust of your users."
"Pinterest continues to make more changes that move the app further and further away from why I use it: to find, save, and share ideas. I finally decided to write this review because the primary “+” button now isn’t for pins but for Instragram-like “stories”. Now you have to hunt to find the right “+” button under profile to add a pin from a website. 

Additionally, users no longer have control to edit the title and description of pins. Just notes to self or comments. I used to use this heavily for describing my modifications to recipes or notes on what I’d like to do on a particular project with my wife. The loss of control is frustrating. 

Lastly, Instagram’s approach to advertisements is anti-customer. I understand the need to monetize, but PLEASE don’t make the interaction so challenging that it “traps” your users in the ad. Two examples of this: 1) you can’t swipe down to dismiss an ad like you do any other pin - you have to reach up to the top-left of your screen and tap on the small back arrow, and 2) swiping up opens the ad instead of showing similar content - so then you have to tap “done” and the back arrow to get back to normal content. Instead, you should make the interaction/navigation similar to all other content. Your ads are “landmines” and I get so frustrated when I tap on one. Doesn’t have to be that way."
"I have been so disappointed and frustrated by the ads, especially the video ads! First people who have visual problems there should be a way to at least turn off the motion of the ads, like an accessibility feature! Then before I even scroll down there are three ads a page if not more! I wish there was at least a paid version for people who really dislike the ads taking over Pinterest. This has almost put me over the edge with giving up on this app. Now worst of all you incorporate an unorganized button in the exact spot as the old save button... why?! The entire point of Pinterest is organizing a catalog of things you like. Why create a board that is unorganized and if it’s really for quick saves then MOVE THE BUTTONS! Leave the normal save button when you chose a board then hit save and switch the new “chose a board” button to the QUICK SAVE BUTTON! Don’t change the entire way to save pins based off of this new quick save feature!! Add a button and leave the original way to save untouched. Please at least create an option to turn off quick save option in settings!! Also a paid version for ad free or at very minimum an accessibility feature for vision impaired individuals for the movement of all the video ads!!! Please, please consider this or I’m unfortunately going to have to give up on Pinterest. Thanks for any consideration."
"I can’t imagine not having Pinterest. I could be without all other websites and social media, but the creative side of me needs my Pinterest fix. I’m able to organize all of my ideas which is great for me because my mind runs 90mph with these ideas every day either way. I love my secret boards. I love trying new things. This year I have a new raised garden bed and redoing my front yard. One of my favorite things about it is that I can make Pinterest my MAIN Wishlist/Registry I don’t have to make a bunch of different registries for events... I can add people to a board and pin things from ANY website. So I don’t have to remember all those passwords for those individual sites. (Example: You’re having a baby and want to have a Target Registry, Babies R Us Registry, Buy Buy Baby Registry, etc etc...) Instead of doing them all separately you can just pin all the products you want from those websites directly to ONE BOARD on Pinterest. You can add your friends and family to the board or you can just send them your board link. They can follow the link and look at everything you’ve pinned in one place and make a purchase. You don’t need to create registries anymore. Everything I need is available on Pinterest. Thanks y’all!"
"Overall, this app is really great and I love Pinterest. While for a long time Pinterest was mainly for a certain crowd (almost all adults) sharing recipes, crafts, and similar, there’s been a wider variety of content including memes, fandom stuff, tiktoks, etc. which have a much younger crowd. This isn’t a problem in itself, especially since they don’t interact much due to the algorithms. However, some things about this concern me A LOT regarding the safety of kids. 

I see a lot of kids posting photos and videos of themselves in reaction to content and this has me scared for them. Not just teenagers, but CHILDREN. Really young children. Ive seen so many times kids giving out their age and location in the comments for everyone to see!!! This is dangerous and there isn’t any way to report this either!!! I understand that there is no way to completely prevent kids from being on this app, but there needs to be ways to prevent kids from posting information and photos and videos of themselves in the comments like they are. The ability to react to posts like this is great if it were just adults sharing recipes, but this NEEDS to be addressed. As someone who grew up on the internet unmoderated, I had to discover the hard way how creepy some people are. I was lucky to not have had anything major but I could easily see some creep pretending to be 14 or something and messaging these kids."
"As a retired educator of 44 years I have felt bad about students not learning the “basics”.   I am a firm believer in lifetime learning however and have found the internet, especially Pinterest and u tube to be an amazing resource.  My hobbies include woodworking, welding, customizing autos, boats, motorcycles, oil painting, silversmithing, etc.  no day passes that I do not find something valuable.  After camping and hunting for a lifetime I am shocked about how many tips I find to make these hobbies more comfortable or economical.  Think about being turned around in the woods or a city.  Ask seri and you can get out the most isolated spot.  Drive along and see a sign in Spanish or some other language and you can get a translation,  The benefits are endless and Pinterest is a wonderful tool. 
The biggest problem I had with public school students was the question “where are we going to use this?”  If you are in an unsatisfactory, dead end job then education is the rescue.  Education does not have to be classical academic.  It can be welding, home building, concrete work, electrical, auto repair, beauty school, or what ever you are interested in.  Pinterest can answer a lot of questions about whether to proceed into a field. Keep an open mind!"
"This used to be one of my favorite apps. I got my husband hooked on it as well. But now it seems that ads are taking over. Too many buyable pins that have nothing to do with anything I’ve ever looked at or saved. And way too much pornography for a site that claims they don’t allow it. I highly doubt that a picture of a naked woman with her legs spread and that links to a xxx site is considered “art”.  I agree that in artistic instances nudity would be acceptable, but on a site that I am supposed to be able to hand my phone over to my child to play on, these things shouldn’t be on there. I get that it’s the same risk you run with using the net, but these things show up in home feeds when you’ve never looked at anything remotely close to it. My husband showed me a funny gun meme and as her scrolled through the “more like this” several naked women came up. If the pinning rules aren’t going to be enforced, there should be some sort of family filter you can click on. I’ve also noticed over the past couple days, my husband has a recents tab in his boards page that I don’t have. This is actually pretty handy if I’ve looked at something but didn’t pin. Seems like if I try to go back and find something I’ve seen earlier in the day, it’s impossible to find again. 
With a few improvements and enforcements it could be better."
"I absolutely love Pinterest, I’ve used it for years. The only reason I’m giving it a 4 instead of 5 stars is that recently (meaning a few weeks ago) I realized I can no longer “try pins”. At first I just thought it was a little glitch but seeing as other people have updated the app and said the option is gone is kind of a bummer. I mean, Pinterest is an idea app and a diy place where you share your ideas and how they turned out with other people. How are you supposed to show how it turned out without the try pin? I’d love it if this feature came back. Another thing that disappointed me was that  I saw another review saying the sections inside of boards were taken away? Of course, this review was left a year ago but still, I’ve been hesitant to even update my Pinterest in case this is still happening. I use sections inside all of my boards because sometimes I’ll have a board for my house but I section them off from bedroom, bathroom, etc. and it’d be really difficult to find what I’m looking for if that’s taken away. Anyways, I know I just went on and on about all the things I wish could be fixed but honestly it’s not that much and I really do love Pinterest, it’s my favorite app. :)"
"I love this app for finding and organizing all sorts of crafts, recipes, home tips, etc. but it is really irritating to continuously have a bar popping up at the top of each webpage asking if I have found what I want. Most of the time I am pulling these sites from my own saved pins so yes, I have found what I wanted because that’s why I use your app, to find what I have saved here. That, and when I am choosing a pin from a search I notice that this question bar loads before the page even loads and takes up part of the page. At that point it’s just annoying to be asked if I found what I wanted because I can’t see the webpage yet and certainly don’t know what is within the page yet to know if I did indeed find what I wanted. Please consider altering how and when you ask your users if they found what they wanted. Maybe the pop-up could be altered to only pop up when a search from the home page is done. Also, maybe change it to pop up 30 seconds after the user clicks a link so they have a chance to see what is on the page before being asked for feedback. Overall, I still love your app and use it all the time. I just want to stop seeing this pop-up every time I open a link I’ve had saved for years. Thank you."
"hi! i love pinterest, i’ve been using it since like 2012 when i got my first ipod touch. It’s been awesome and i have like, a gazillion boards for fashion and art references and nerdy projects and i love it BUUUTTTT ya’ll switched up the way we choose the board we’re saving a pin to and i am not okay. I had the max number of boards (150?) and then when the max number rose i’ve continued to make more and more boards and honestly??? manually scrolling past every single board i’ve made since i was 14 instead of the alphabet slider is TOUGH but then to top it off, whenever i pass the board im looking for, when i try to scroll up it just closes the whole screen and im back starting at the pin i wanted to save but couldn’t. It is such a hassle and the select-a-board screen is so sensitive that sometimes it takes me like 3-4 tries to pin something. and when i use a board that has a ton of sections in it, i have to successfully navigate the new way to pin things ✨twice✨ to actually pin something. I’m in my 20s, i grew up on tech, im not dumb. please at least make the slider less sensitive, and i’d really appreciate getting the alphabet slider back. i’m dying 🥺"
"I use to love Pinterest. It was my favorite. I chose what I wanted to look at. Then they started changing things and changing things more and more. Made us have to look at their stupid ads and suggested posts. Now it has gotten to the point to where 90 percent of everything is ads and suggested posts-guess what I don’t want to see what you have suggested. I want to see what I want to see-what I chose to follow. There is no way to remove the crap and even if you report and remove the incessant ones, they just add that many more. Here’s a little tip-I do not want to see and have no interest in pins that are in a foreign language and I have to look at them constantly. So I’m really getting over Pinterest. Add in the fact that I can’t see who pins what anymore-I like seeing when the people I follow that I like have pinned something but now I can’t tell because it’s blank where a user use to be listed. Every update it gets worse and I find myself getting on Pinterest less and less. I am quickly losing my interest in Pinterest. They need to go back to letting people control what they look at. I could understand having some ads but the amount of content on my board that I didn’t follow has gotten way out of control. If it doesn’t get any better and I keep getting pins in foreign languages then I will just quit using it. I hope it improves soon. If not then I will stop using it."
"I always loved Pinterest since 2014 when I was 14 and I’m 21 now. Since then I’ve considered it a ‘safe place’ free from ads and the traps of marketing where I could gather ideas and get creative without the pressure of social media. 

I have never made a review, but this app is just too close to my heart and it hurts to see it fall down. Recently, it’s just the same as other platforms. I can now rarely find a good recipe or a creative outfit. Every other pic is an advertisement for a waist trainer or TikTok influencers. I wouldn’t mind too much if it was less frequent like it was before but now it’s every other pin. It’s distracting to the point where I can’t find any good pins. Instead of it being a curative list of pins in your style, it’s tiktoks of influencers showing you the most recent trends. I can now barely find any pins that appeal to my style. It’s all those short videos or tiktoks that are just ads.  

The videos distract from the picture pins so I end up not seeing what I came to Pinterest for. It’s an ad fest just like Instagram and TikTok where the strategy is to get you hooked on watching those short useless videos for hours. I deleted TikTok and Instagram for a reason, and now all apps are turning into it. Pinterest has almost completely lost its individuality and I’m sure it’s just downhill from here. It’s a shame, but if it continues this way I’ll be forced to get off of it."
"I have been using the Pinterest app for years now, and these updates may be terrible enough for me to finally leave. First of all, the stories/slides function is confusing and difficult to use. If I’m ever swiping through content it’s a hassle to get through these stories that often have nothing to do with what I’ve pinned in the past, which brings me to my next point: the algorithm. I am constantly getting both suggested pins and targeted ads that have nothing to do with any boards or searches I’ve made! My home feed is full of ads that I am not interested in with very little actual content, much of which is irrelevant as well. It seems like the “hide pin” feature doesn’t even do anything to improve my feed. To me, it seems like Pinterest is struggling to remain relevant in the wake of Instagram and TikTok by introducing new features and changing up how content reaches viewers, but I think I speak for the majority of Pinterest users when I say that people don’t use Pinterest in the same way we use other platforms. There’s no need for flash and flair when Pinterest is already a well-designed social media platform with a specific user base in mind, and making these changes just interrupts the way people use the app."
"My favorite part of this app was the fact that I could go to explore and find new ideas, hence why I always have so many boards. New ideas would pop up in the explore and i would love it and go crazy looking for new ideas from pinterest by looking through the explore every chance I got but you guys got rid of the explore. Now when i click one pin even by accident i get 50 more pins for the exact same pin. Sometimes It would be one simple recipe of pie and now i have 30 of them everyday. So then you guys created an option where I can not get specific suggestions from what I clicked but even when I unfollow what I clicked it doesnt matter because my feed is literally still exact suggestions from my boards I created. So i feel like i dont get anywhere with this app. I am literally on instagram all the time because I can see different new things not different versions of the same thing especially ones I pinned already. Its fine when im searching for something but after a while I get the point and I get off the app. I wont even bring up the ads. Sorry but Im done with this app. I sure i wont be the last. Your new users dont know what their missing but seeing the same sweater everyday will get boring for them too eventually. Bring back explore so we can see new ideas, stop thinking i want to see 80 different versions of a pink Christmas tree."
"I love this app, and have been using it for awhile. But this new update layout is very ugly, it would be great it you guys made it back to its other layout, this new layout feels pointless, and makes it harder to navigate.                                                                            Edit: Now on top of the bad layout that still has not been reverted, you have gotten rid of the feature to see what boards pins are saved too, which is an awful, awful decision, as now I can’t find boards I like that help me expand my related boards. So now I just have to find profiles and hope they have stuff I like, which should NOT be how I find boards I like. These updates are ruining the app more and more and it’s making me enjoy it less and less. I could get use to the new layout, but taking away the feature to see boards that pins were saved on is crossing the line, you are making this app a hassle to navigate and you won’t even listen to anyone’s feedback no matter how many reviews and emails you get. I’m almost done with this app, I’ve given it much more time to fix than it deserves at this point and you people don’t seem to care to fix it’s horrible problems that YOU cause."
"I note the feed for ‘home’ is thankfully the same as before, with multiple pix across the page, but the feed for ‘following’ is single, large format pix., making it difficult to consume many photos for time spent. Please, please change this back! That said, I have been a long-time Pinterest user and have seen it go through a lot of changes. I have to say they have been pretty responsive to requests, overall. You can now opt between suggested pin feed, or feed from people you follow. You can once more arrange boards to suit. You can also choose how you want to view boards, 3 across, 4 across, or a page of small thumbnails. Also, as many Secret boards as you like. Something for everyone. It used to be far more social, as far as associating people with their pins, even when they were re-pinned...although problems sprang up with people being very protective about the artistry of their boards and discouraging people from pinning more than a few pins a day, and so things changed. I agree with many that the promoted pins can be a bit much, and I would prefer not being automatically taken to a site. Still, it is a great app and still allows for lots of creativity and enjoyment."
"I’m all about Pinterest. I love the recipe and meal ideas, the seasonal outfit ideas, the cookie & cake decorating ideas and the ability to find awesome ideas for parties I’m planning. When I first started using Pinterest, years ago, not only could you save a pin, you could click on a little heart and like it. Where did that go? Now, on another person’s board, I saw a little lightbulb in the bottom left of the pin that said to tap and hold for reactions. This is great but when I went into my board to check out my pins it didn’t have that feature. I’d kind of like the option to like a pin again, especially pins personal pins, not just re-pinned things. Will everyone eventually get these reaction buttons? I really hope so. I guess what I’m saying is it would be great if someone saw a pin that was of, say, my own personal content, they would both have the option to “Like” it and to re-pin it. It be nice for the person who’s putting their own content on Pinterest to know if their followers like what they’re pinning. Other than that I think maybe you could slow down on the ads a little. I know Pinterest is free, which is fabulous, but ads popping up more than once or twice during a video is really annoying."
Hi! Before I go into my suggestions I would just like to say I don't leave ratings a whole lot so I don't know if there is a proper way to set up my comment LOL. Anyway I think this app is AWESOME. It runs really well and the quality is just amazing. There is one improvement I have. There are A LOT of pins that have some serious vulgar language. Now I understand you can't really tell people to stop swearing but maybe there is a way to block these pins? Of course I know you can block pinners but maybe instead there is a way to block the pins that have vulgar language instead of blocking the pinner. So you are just blocking one of their pins and not all of there boards. Maybe like a child-friendly mode? It is just really annoying when you are just scrolling through your home feed and boom there is this pin that swears like crazy. I have already turned off recommend pins and unfollowed people that pin pins that have vulgar language but I still run in to this problem. I just don't want to see that stuff. Anyway I don't know if this is possible but if it is I think it would be an awesome improvement. Again this is a great app and I totally suggest downloading it.
"This app used to be perfectly functional but now it is completely dysfunctional . The purpose of Pinterest is to save “pins” and sort them into “boards” so that you may have an organized place to save various pictures/ links of different themes . Now , every pin you save automatically saves to something called “profile” and if you want to sort it into a specific board you have to go out of your way to change it which is a huge pain . In addition ,  you are no longer allowed to look at your boards so even if you sort your pins into them you’re only allowed to look at the pins all mixed together in an big ol’ mess . On top of that , now whenever you search for anything it automatically searches for only things that are for sale and you have to manually change it to search the whole of Pinterest . I have spent so much time struggling to find pins I was searching for only to realize it was searching in the “shopping“ tab and that was why I couldn’t find anything . So , essentially they took away the core purposes of the app for no good reason . When will companies start to understand that corporate greed is not going to make them money and is instead the best way to drive your business into the ground ? Please just put this app back to the way it was ."
"I love Pinterest and the app has made it so convenient for me to be able to save the things I like onto boards. Not only that but I can always find creative inspiration for my next art project or meal! It’s like having an online memory box where I can look back years and see how my tastes have changed and evolved. Plus I’ll stumble onto an old project, recipe, or general pin that I like and be able to use it again!
The only thing that I would change about the app is a feature that has pulled up in the newest updates. For example, when I search “brunch ideas” there is a button on the lower center portion of the screen that says “Refine”. While I can appreciate the concept for it, it’s more of an annoyance to have it on top of where I’m scrolling to look at pins. I think it would be a better fit at the top of the screen in the same section as the search bar so that it eliminates the issue of a button covering part of my pins. It’s a small issue, however it can become quite cumbersome when I don’t want to refine anything. Even if there was a way to turn it off/close it when I don’t want it, that would be great! So far I haven’t been able to find out how to do that.
Even with this, I still love the app!"
"Content is lovely, Pinterest is good at recommending stuff I like. I also enjoy that images can have any dimensions. But there’s a few issues that drive me crazy. 
1. The comments. Sometimes there’s ones missing, sometimes it says there’s comments but none show up, sometimes you can’t click on replies. I’m not sure how but it never works completely. Just spent 20 minutes trying to post 4 replies and failed, so I’m a bit frustrated. 
2. Zooming in on an image is very difficult, since it opens “more like this” which covers about a third of the screen. You can’t even scroll down to the bottom of the image without having to keep your finger on the screen so it doesn’t get covered by More Like This again.
3. The visual search button on the bottom right that sometimes covers content there the bottom, you can zoom in to read text underneath the white magnifying glass, but then you gotta deal with the More Like This pop up.
4. Personal preference, but I don’t like the story format that automatically switches image, I can never read/look at everything in the image before it already moves on to the next, so I have to click to go back constantly. As far as I know there’s no way to block that form of content."
"... but the app keeps freezing and crashing! My iPhone is completely up to date software-wise, and I’ve downloaded the latest version of the app, so that’s up to date, too. Now, I love Pinterest. It gives me ideas and let’s me enjoy my different fandoms and all kinds of stuff. I can get lost scrolling through my homepage for hours! Except, far too often, I’ll be happily scrolling along, pinning things to different boards, and everything freezes so I can neither keep going, not go back, nor exit the pin I was on to see the rest of the page. Sometimes I can go to another section of the app, like search or my profile, but a lot of times the screen goes black and won’t respond until I exit the app. And then, if I simply re-open the app it’s still frozen. I have to close out of it completely and re-start the app to see anything or have any interaction, and by then I’ve lost the pin I was on and I just have to hope I can find it again. It’s very frustrating! I’ve rage-quit Pinterest, something that seems impossible, but that happens at least once a week, because the freezing and the blank screen happens several times a day."
"I have used Pinterest for over ten years. I have loved this app/website. There is nothing else like it. Over the last couple of years, though, my feed quality has really suffered. I used to see new pins based on every one of my interests, which I had carefully cultivated. I could go months without seeing the same pin twice, and my feed was full of variety and color. Now, my feed seems to be based only on recent activity, so if I only pin to three boards over a few days or a week, I will only see content related to those three boards with maybe 1/20 being outside of those topics. If I only pin from my home feed, that means that I’m reinforcing this funnel until my home feed looks the same every single day. If I pass over a pin without saving it, it can show up in my feed again and again, making things feel stale. I’ll also see pins related to topics I don’t like, but even though I hide it, that topic will show up in my feed again and again as if I had never touched it. Also, when I do a search I’ll only get a few pages’ worth of related pins before it starts looking like my home feed, with results that have nothing to do with what I’m searching for. I still use the app because there’s no other available resource like it, but it’s no longer my favorite place for inspiration."
"Since really joining Pinterest, not just sneaking onto the site now and then, I have become a bigger person in heart and soul. Not just counting the extra fat on my bottom that seems to grow bigger and bigger because of the ‘Rona virus and me just sitting on it. Any fat around my waist is also because of the that virus but here I need to put blame where blame is due.  ON ME!  But just a little on Pinterest too...because  I become glued to the site for hours on end, looking at pictures of wonderful foods...I swear they just leave the internet screen and absorb right into my body.  Really it doesn’t happen that way.  Joking people, just joking.  But not about the becoming absorbed in the subject matter.  It is such a wonderful site that takes me away from everything for awhile.  Thank you Pinterest, a heartfelt thank you for all the deliciousness I see, the beautiful art, the intricate sewing, the gorgeous quilting and paperwork, the ‘everything’ to see with just the tap of a button.  How fortunate we are to view things from our very own country and the countries of other like individuals.  What an honor.  I am honored. Thank you."
"the statement below was my previous rating, till I realized that Pinterest created an old-school space under the ""following"" tag where I only see images from people I'm following... exactly why people fell in love with Pinterest to begin with. thank you so much for going back to the basics, and even though you still have these whack ads, they're on the ""home"" section, not the ""following"" one, so yay!!! please don't muck it up with ads on the ""following"" section. what you did is genius, and now everyone should be happy.

old review: why, Pinterest? why? I don't understand why you continue to push pins from people I don't follow. I don't follow them for a reason. don't you understand that pinterest is visual therapy for many, that is, they log in and get much relief from seeing all the ideas they've pinned as well as pins from people or boards they follow. but then we see ugly images that are supposedly taken from our own interests, and they muck up the whole flow of image therapy. then I have to click ""hide"" one image after the other after the other until I get so sick and tired of seeing the same ugly pics and just close the app. you guys are whack."
"For the las several months I’ve consistently tried  to understand how the Pinterest can misrepresent the maximum number of stored pins as being 200,000 The embarrassing Pinterest app algorithm doesn’t send error message prior any such 200,000 pin limit. It allowed 55,000 additional pins to saved before an error message was sent to user that they reached their number of stored pins. Meanwhile, the number of boards allowed has increased four fold? That’s absurd. The capricious response to question about why someone is forced to tear six years of work because the app developers didn’t include a basic feature that prevents any pin count over the alleged 200,000 pin limit. Just so I’m clear the solution to this problem issue is do nothing but adopt intransigence as customer service tool. The poor performance behavior of Pinterest app isn’t the burden of the user. The ethical response to the problem is to add a solution to the problem in Pinterest app feature, not insult the intelligence of career customer service reps like myself. What I described was clear example of maxim, you get what you pay for. My phone could never get away with redundancy and deflection as response to horrible lack foresight by Pinterest app developers."
"I’ve been asking for sub-boards for years and Pinterest finally delivered! Although you previously had keyword terms show up in boards, you couldn’t create your own, so it wasn’t as great. But now you can! The only bad thing though is I’m seeing a few glitches on mine. Since we can create our own sections within boards, I tried to combine a couple of my original boards into sections on just 1 board. I noticed that every time you edited the location of a group of pins from one board to another, you had to close back out of the app afterwords because the other board wouldn’t appear in the new destination list when you tried to switch some more over again. Then, since I thought all of the pins from one board had successfully been moved to the other board, I deleted the original, only to find out for some reason that they hadn’t actually been moved to the other one. I lost an entire board today😢 please fix! Also maybe have suggestions as to which pins belong in which sections? Other than that though, the new feature is great."
"I love pinterest and I think the new layout is quite interesting... However, there are many essential qualities of this app that I’ve carried issues with for a long time now. The inconsistency of their effectiveness, for one, is major.  Sometimes I’ll get a notification on my phone saying someone has commented or saved one of my pins... But after opening the app and checking the notifications tab I’ll find nothing at all. This doesn’t always happen but usually it does and I find it super annoying.

Another example of this issue with inconsistencies— or perhaps simply an issue in general—is when I DO manage to receive a notification from someone liking or responding to my comments on pins. Upon clicking on this notification I am not directed to the actual pin itself— but merely a non-interactive image of the pin with the comment section below it. Once again, it doesn’t always happen but is especially frustrating when I want to save this pin to another board or perhaps haven’t saved it at all and wish to do so... Yet I am unable to and my only resort is to take a screenshot and search it up on my own terms. (Even then it’s almost always unsuccessful.)

Like I said, Pinterest is a great app with good means— but it is small annoyances like the ones aforementioned that keep me from calling it perfect."
"Why bring the quick saves back? It was better without them, how can we tell if we saved that pin before or not it’ll involve clicking out of the photo and trying to save it to see. Advertisements are literally taking over and videos/shopping are at the top. I don’t want video/pictures to click into I want pictures to save, ideas to save not videos. I mean sometimes videos are okay I save them sometimes but they are repetitive videos at the top when looking for similar pictures, at least put them in the middle they are disruptive especially the ads when scrolling up. Fine! Keep the ads, get rid of the excessive video pop ups! I change my mind, so many excessive ads and random auto playing of advertisements, it’s too loud! Keep the videos! Also give us back pictures in comments, it’s an enjoyment to share especially art! Don’t take that away please! Update: Also, before the update into quick saves it was easier to save, didn’t have to scroll to the certain board I created. Now they are suggesting me my boards that I have that aren’t even nearly related to the photos I try to save…don’t even get me started on the automatic refresh when there are so many brilliant photos to be saved, I cry!🥲😂"
"Whether it’s on chrome mobile, chrome desktop, or either app, after pinning a bunch of pins, it simply stops working. I’ve cleared cashe, logged out, logged back in. After a while it will say “oops, you’ve been logging in a lot. Either wait 30 minutes or log in with Facebook or google.”  It’s ridiculous! If I want to pin 100 times, why won’t it let me?  I’ve seriously spent two days trying to pin 150 pins. I’ve only been able to pin 97. It’s like it doesn’t want you to use it or something!

I agree with everything admod08 said in her “so sick of it” review. While browsing pics in chrome or safari, if you tap on the photo that is on Pinterest, it forces you to download the app. Then when you want to go back to the photos you were looking at, Pinterest takes you to the home page. I’ve gotten to the point where if I see a pic that says it’s on Pinterest, I just look over it and find a different pic. I hate how Pinterest has completely taken over everything. We have no control. It’s not very user friendly. You want to go to the website where the pic is, and it’s so hard to figure out what to tap, that half the time I can’t find the website. It takes me to other pins or to the homepage of the person who pinned it. I just want to go to the bloody website where the original pic is!"
"I used to use Pinterest more than any other social media but since these latest updates I’ve been using it less and less. Every time I pin something, 75% of the following pins are the same subject or even the same pin repeated. I like how the app is recognizing my interests but I can’t keep my followers over the same chicken recipe.
I also miss the circles in the bottom corner since it was able to easily see some related pins without getting lost in the “more like this” pages. It was also nice to see who pinned what on the homepage so I can continue to follow people who use the app and unfollow people who no longer do without having to go onto every pinner’s page.
Something that Pinterest doesn’t have that I have been craving sense the beginning: SUB-BOARDS!!!! I hate going onto someone’s page and they have over 100 boards and at least 10 are the same subject. With sub-boards pinners could follow and create one board and use smaller boards within the maim board for sub-categories. Say drinks for example and the sub-boards would be alcoholic beverages, smoothies, infusions, etc. Our pages would be so organized and things would be even easier to find with such large boards."
"I’m not sure if it’s the same on computers, but on mobile, the comments really need to improve. When you want to reply to someone’s comment, you can, but if you want to reply to someone’s comment on another person’s comment, you have to manually put the “@“ and write out their whole name. And most of the time this doesn’t even work because their name either has a space in it or their name won’t show up for some reason! 
Another problem with the comments is that when you reply to someone’s comment and someone tries to reply to you within that comment, you get the notification saying like “oh, so-and-so replied to your comment,” but when you click on that notification, it won’t take you to the comment, so there’s no way for you to see it unless you somehow know exactly which pin your comment was on, then go on a whole scavenger hunt to find that one pin that you probably didn’t even save.
I really hope this gets fixed because I really like have conversations with people in the comment section. And on top of it getting fixed, I want Pinterest to add a feature that lets you see all the pins you’ve commented on, like how Twitter has the “Tweets & Replies” option."
"hello! so I just wanted to start off by saying that I love pinterest! it has a much more friendly environment compared to other social media apps and has a nice format. my only issue with the app is the new feature story pins. I gained access to them on my business account, and I noticed a few things at first. the first asset I would consider changing is only ebig able to access them on a business account. I really wish that you could request them and create on a personal. the second issue with story pins is that I can't create them any more on the mobile app (I am using an iPhone 5s). I was seeing to create them for a month or two, but now when I tap ""create story pin"" pinterest says that I can't create them because I'm not updated. I know that I am updated fully on pinterest, because I was able to create before and I've checked on the App Store that there aren't any new installs. I can only create them on the desktop version of pinterest. this is fine- it isn't as easy but it works. however, on the desktop version there isn't an option to tag someone in the pin (not the description). it would be helpful if you fixed this issue. otherwise, pinterest is an amazing app! thank you!"
"I’ve used Pinterest from the beginning. I used it for almost every aspect of my life from pinning teaching ideas to holiday crafts to recipes and self care.  The recent updates to turn it into primarily a shopping app are outrageously frustrating. I can’t search for anything anymore. I went to try to find ideas for sewing projects, beaded bracelet ideas, IVF organization and it’s all just products products products from big box stores. That’s not inspiration, I know about Target already thank you. They also removed the feature where you could search for other users boards from the app. I used to find the best ideas from searching users boards, like seeing what others had on their “camping” or “mending” boards for example but now you have to be so specific and you can only see sponsored single posts it makes it hard to discover anything new. It’s just unbelievable that now when I search for something like “jewelry projects” or “sewing projects” I just get a million Etsy and Michaels listings for already made projects. Completely useless and I’m so irritated. I’m sad that the golden days of Pinterest were I would turn to it for everything seem to have passed."
"I’ve been using Pinterest since the beginning, when it was invite-only. I planned my wedding with Pinterest, I stumbled onto so many cool ideas and life hacks and interesting people... Pinterest legit made my life *better.* Now I hardly use the app at all. It’s almost all ads, and I hardy ever see content from the people I follow. Even worse is the search function, which is... pathetic, to say the least. Pinterest used to be fantastic for helping me find inspiring images and links for just about *anything* I was looking for; now searches only yield a handful of results, all of which are ads, *none* of which are actually relevant to my search. I’ve been using Google image search a lot more now. Pinterest has become essentially useless to me. I’m not seeing content I like, I’m not able to search for content I like, and with so many ads, the “social” aspect of this so-called “social media platform” is nonexistent. Seriously, what’s the point? I’m holding out hope that developers will take critiques like this seriously and restore some of the functions that made Pinterest such a great app, but... I’m losing patience. If things don’t get better I’ll probably just delete the app and save space on my phone... why keep a useless app around?"
"I love Pinterest. I’ve been using it almost every day for over 7 years. Love the App! It’s only gotten. Better  Love the content and the concepts! I love the algorithm, always shows me perfectly related searches and ideas for crafts for look books! I’m able to collaborate with people and create coordinated projects. I use it for vision boarding my goals, picking an outfit in the morning,  and putting together my dreams! It’s very easy to use! Very forgiving of any mistakes I make with my fat fingers. 

One bug. In version 7.41.2 the app keeps freezing on me. I’ll be scrolling and my screen will freeze and the app will, after a couple minutes of fighting, shut down. Or I’ll be in a post and it’s just unresponsive. When this happens I usually close it, open another app and it’s working fine, my phone isn’t frozen so I  give Pinterest a moment and it works again but it’s been happening almost every time I open the app! Never got a bug like this that lasted this long, usually you guys are good at sending updates to catch them in time before I loose my mind. 
Update soon please!! 
Keep up the good work"
"This app has changed my life by becoming a lit boomer as my kids say. I learned how to hit the whip and now i do it everywhere I go and even hit the whip on my lit kids. This app has taught me how to make some baller chocolate chip cookies and ever since i learned how to make these baller chocolate chip cookies my kids say “ I am the best boomer mom ever. “ This app also taught me how to do tik tok dances like Charli D’Melio and Addison Rae. I now do the renegade in public and get told I am crazy but i alwyas tell the people sorry you can’t be a lit boomer like me. I even learned new bedroom ideas like Teenage Mutant Turtles bedrooms to Lighting Mcqueen bedrooms for my son who is failing classes.( My son is 20) I learned new ideas like bedrooms for my daughter who is 28 and has NO JOB and the ideas are like Little mermaid bedrooms and Princesses Bedrooms. I even learned new songs like No Idea by Don Toliver and Out West by Travis Scott and btw those songs slap as my kids would say. This is my end of my review and my name is Karen and I am a lit boomer and I would like to tell everyone on Pinterest that you are lit and cool and Pinterest is the best app. 

                Thank you."
"It might be that I am just getting used to these type of social media formats, but I was hoping to find more art nudes, interesting photography/photographers, experimental works, and perhaps links to auctions, galleries, etc... I joined having searched for an artist whose only bio was linked to Pinterest. This phobia of nudity or nude photography being considered pornography almost has the opposite intent:  de legitimizes formats with the best “intentions” for random queries with no sense of values, aesthetics, social, or otherwise. Access to art is more important ultimately I am learning in this strange social experiment of internet media shuffle fraught with so much garbage. What we permit in terms of violence in both media and society, in pornographic policy making should be of greater concern than exposure to the many forms the human body presents as a muse and as artistic expression itself. As was always the case, Art follows nature. And if not, it is our nature. So silly and tiring does this game then become. I can’t participate in something so full of itself that pretends to be on a higher ground only to literally cover its buttocks ( breast’s, vagina, etc...). Maybe there was something I missed, but it seemed like a very deliberate decision and as a store of images, art, commerce, I can’t in good conscience support it."
"This is more about Pinterest itself than the app. Every fourth or so pin in my feed is an ad now, so the platform is pretty much useless to me because all I can think about as I’m scrolling is if I’m looking at another ad or not because I kept accidentally clicking them, which then takes me to the ad provider’s website page and away from my Pinterest feed. This to me almost feels like a strategy Pinterest is using: more ads = more people clicking the ads = more revenue. While I understand the mindset behind ad revenue and don’t disagree with it, Pinterest incorporates way too many ads to the point that it’s excessive and not as fun of a platform as it used to be. I can barely look at the pins by users I wanted to actually follow without seeing the same ads over and over again. I don’t know if it’s as many ads on the computer or not, but I definitely won’t be using this app again anytime soon. 

I’m disappointed in what Pinterest has become, and a happy medium needs to be found for how many ads are in user feeds. I’ll be using Instagram as my source of learning about new products and experiences from now on, benefits I used to get from using Pinterest. While Instagram has ads, they aren’t nearly as frequent and irritating as those on Pinterest."
"look, i am an avid Pinterest defender. i believe it is one of the most useful and aesthetically pleasing apps out there and has a format that is simple enough to get used to. but over the last year or so i’ve been getting disappointed in the newer updates. im all for change and growing as a company and moving with the industry, but Pinterest used to be able to cater and filter specifically to pictures and pins that i was searching for. i think thats what made Pinterest so easy to enjoy and find glee in making boards. i really liked the feature of making your profile as one of your existing boards and then boom, that feature seems to have just been removed completely and if you change it to something new you can’t remove the cover at all. and the small topic/tabs being completely removed from searches and making it so difficult to find specific pins. its just the small details that are coming and going without reason. i used to really love this app and i still do but it is just so frustrating. i really hope there can be improvements in the future because all this is causing is me to be constantly frustrated with the app."
"I absolutely loved Pinterest. It was an app that literally everything that I need help on, like drawing, cooking, painting, etc. It was going well and I was going to go back on it to look at a drawing method that I was going to show my friend, but it logged me out. I thought of it as nothing, so I logged back into my account, which was Abyssinky. I logged in, put my password, and it said something was wrong and that something happened and that they were sorry. I thought it would be fixed soon, but it still wasn’t. I put everything in correctly, since I wrote it on a sticky note because I’m a bit forgetful. It kept saying that something went wrong. I deleted the app, hoping for my data to be reset and that the problem would be over by now, but it kept showing up in red and saying it wasn’t working. I logged into another account to check if my Abyssinky account got deleted or something, but it was still there with all my boards. I had that account for about two months, and am a bit sad. I know it’s not your guy’s fault, that it might be a glitch in the system. But I do hope you see to this problem and that others see this review. Thank you for reading this!"
"I’ve been a loyal Pinterest user since I was sixteen years old. I’ve always found new ideas, inspiration, and even just good pics on there. 
And then the app updated.
Now I see videos and tiktoks all recommended for me. Instead of swiping left on my pinterest homescreen to see more ideas for my boards, I now can swipe left to watch tiktok-like shorts- just like on every other social media platform now. The reason I’ve been so loyal to pinterest was because it was unlike every other platform. 
But now I’m realizing that they’re apparently not. I honestly don’t care if other people want to collect videos - good for you - but pinterest was started as a diy and picture collecting site, not as a place to watch things (some of you may remember the old days when gifs were even hard to find on the old ‘rest). 
I guess I’m more disappointed than anything. After years of having the app on my phone, I’ve just recently begun contemplating deletion simply to escape the temptation of getting stuck in a seemingly endless loop of fifteen-second videos. Very disappointed that this is what the app has become."
"So Pinterest is an amazing app and I love it but some things on here really need to be worked on. I use this app every day to get inspiration for all sorts of things and while I’m looking through pins and I find one I like I’ll click on it to look at it in more detail and the entire app will freeze. So then I have to restart the app and even then it’s stupid because the pin I liked and was looking at is no longer there anymore. Next, when I go to post in a community I’ll click on the “start a discussion..” text bar and the the app will crash and take me back to my home screen. I’ve done everything I could to see if maybe it was just my phone, but no, it’s the app. It crashes when I go to post in communities, every time.🙃 lastly, I’ll be on my feed or whatever tab and then suddenly the screen turns completely white and all the pins and everything off my feed disappears. Normally I can fix this by going to another tab and then going back to the tab that was blank and then it’ll work fine, but it’ll automatically reload the page and the pins I was looking at before the screen turned blank aren’t there anymore. like I said. I love this app, but this is getting real annoying, real quick. Kinda makes me wanna delete it sometimes."
"I love Pinterest. I love the craftiness, the free patterns, recipes, and DIY stuff! Truly, Pinterest has given me weeks’ worth of sewing patterns for doll clothes, helped me kill ants and fruit flies, and FINALLY get a smeary film of a huge mirror. I just have one request. We used to be able to report broken links. That has disappeared, with at least the last few updates. Now we can report pins, for all manner of politically correct reasons (bullying, harassment, etc.), yet can’t just tell you when it doesn’t work. In my years using Pinterest, I have only ever had three types of reports to make: when a link is broken; when it sends you to a page that does not contain what you asctally clicked on; or my biggest beef— when the pin promises free pattern or instructions, and you click on it and wade through a dozen ads, only to reach the comment at the bottom, “Sorry, tha pattern is no longer available for free!” Those pins should be reported and their content pulled. I don’t appreciate false advertising. And Pinterest does not even let users report those things. Thanks for listening."
"I love Pinterest and I use it almost every day—which is the only reason I’m taking the time to write this review. Seems like (pretty major) changes to the UI/UX have been constant recently. It’s frustrating to have to figure out the differences so frequently. Beyond that, they’re just strange. It continues to get more difficult/complicated to add a new pin at all (even more so from a web link)—why would you redesign something that makes features of your app more frustrating to use? Especially when you push the browser button so heavily for use on desktops... why make the closest equivalent on the mobile app so hidden and take so many extra “taps”? Visually, the design of the individual pin view is just so odd and nonsensical to me. Why does each section need to be so entirely separate? Why waste so much space with these huge rounded corners? It makes it a visually cluttered experience. Also, sometimes I want to pin a particular image to multiple boards because it fits in multiple places for me. Recent updates have made doing so more difficult and frustrating. I guess maybe I’m in a minority for that one, but generally taking a scolding/patronizing tone with your users seems like a poor choice."
"As a visual person, Pinterest is a remarkable resource for seeking out really anything my heart desires.  I used to “google” things when I had a question, but as far as quick answers are concerned, Pinterest is definitely my go to. 
From recipes, crafts, building ideas and pure scrolling entertainment, it is a fantastic venue to save and catalog your ideas. I love how blogs and businesses can share their best practices and products directly to their actively looking audience. 
As you can tell by the magnitude of my pins, I have found more than I was looking for!  I love Pinterest and think they carved a perfect niche for themselves out of the bustling infrastructure of the web and I am glad they did. 
If I could change anything, I would get rid of the new system of uninvited ads bombarding the search content, especially the oversized video plugs. They litter the searches and belittle  the organic marketing that has been fostered here.
I still enjoy the purpose and function of the platform and appreciate the ease at which I am able to find what I need... now back to figuring out what to do with  cantaloupe seeds."
"I love Pinterest, but it’s getting ridiculous. Me and my friend spend all day messaging pins back in forth, but since the new spam rules have been set, I can only send 2 things to her before I get blocked. Here’s how it works, if they get annoyed with me, have an option where they can block me, DONT JUST DO IT FOR THEM! And what is with the ads and pins that I’m not even into? Are you even trying anymore Pinterest? Just cause I’m fat doesn’t mean every other ad should support plus sized women’s clothing(which I’ve never looked up on Pinterest so how they even figured out I’m plus sized is a mystery to me) and just because I like a certain topic doesn’t mean I don’t want to see pins from other boards that don’t always see eye to eye with me. That’s why I used to love Pinterest so much, because I could follow boards by other users with similar tastes, and if I wanted to explore into other people’s boards, I’d type something into search like “horses” and look at the pins, found user I liked and followed their boards so their stuff would pop up more in my feed. Please get back on you A game Pinterest! I’ll take this post down when you fix the spam thing!"
"Do not like that ads play sound. I am trying to browse on a bus or something when all of a sudden it blasts out this ad for a tv show. Very embarrassing  

I love Pinterest because every time you open it there is something new to look at. There’s a never ending amount of things to see. Your feed is totally customizable so you can see things you’re interested in and avoid things you’re not. If Pinterest shows you something you’re not interested in you just say I don’t want to see things like that and it learns your preferences. You can keep everything you see saved on boards organized however you want. I don’t even have any other apps on my phone for entertainment except Pinterest because nothing else compares!! Also, you don’t have to be a girl to use Pinterest! There’s tons of guy things from cars to fishing and hunting to at home DIY projects. You can use Pinterest for literally everything in your life whether it’s cooking or clothes or entertainment or nature or music, it doesn’t matter.... it has everything!! Do not like the new borders around the pins when you open them."
"After pinterest updated on the 28th I’ve been having an irrevocably troublesome time quickly pinning things to my own boards. The feature that’s activated through pressing and holding a pin pulls up several smaller icons that allow for different functionality. I’ve become accustomed to pressing and holding to immediately put something onto a board because everything used to be familiar. Now after the update, the main feed has several new icons that appear alongside the previous ones when pressing and holding, and because of this, I have permanently hidden pins that I would’ve originally added to my boards because apparently, SOMEBODY thought it was a good idea to put the “HIDE PIN” icon in the exact same location as the previous “SAVE PIN”icon.

Further more, there appears to be no clear and straightforward way to undo any of the hidden pins which is frustrating for me, someone who has gotten used to pinterest’s old way of doing things! Lol

Pinterest is a fine app for inspiration but the interface definitely needs to be rethought again."
"I love pinterest, but the updates and glitches sometimes make me want to delete it. One problem I have is that when you click to see comments, it will say “one more” or however many comments there are on a pin, but when you click it none of them appear. Pinterest also removed the feature where you can comments pictures which is also really annoying because they made the comments worse instead of fixing them. Aside from that, they keep adding more useless updates and updates that would be good if they actually worked. For example the pronouns feature is great, but after you open and close the app it will make the pronouns you selected go away. They added a “read more” button in your bio that people have to click to see the rest of your bio which is really annoying and pointless since people could see your entire bio already until the update. In general, the app is very glitchy and doesn’t work properly. When I try to download images, it gives me a notification that says my request couldn’t be completed even if the image did download which is very annoying, and when you add a business account the profile cover glitches out and looks really bad. I could go on about this forever. PLEASE FIX YOUR APP!!!"
"I’m a user of Pinterest almost since the beginning of it. As an old user I must say that I love it for the inspiration it gives me. And giving me the opportunity to create boards for things I like. 
BUT there is a problem I’ve noticed lately. The images show different content and the link sends you somewhere else. The main reason I use Pinterest is to save ideas or inspiration from the pictures, but also to save something I like and when I have the time I click the link to direct me to what I see. And lately that’s not happening. I see a lot of spam if I can call them like this. A lot of pictures not connected right with the link. Is very misleading and annoying to me. 
I would be glad if you could fix that again. 
Personally I own a store on Etsy and I don’t like my pictures to advertise someone else’s store. I’ve seen my pictures on Pinterest linked to another store or other pictures linked to my store. That’s very bad cause people will report it as a spam. Which I had nothing to do with. I think this is a problem it’s happening that only the Pinterest app could resolve. 
Thank you!"
"Tech support does not exist. Unlike other apps, I cannot communicate with anyone. It’s not the first time I’ve tried to contact Pinterest. After 1-2 weeks I receive emails (paraphrased), “We haven’t heard from you so we assume the problem has been fixed.” I’ve tried to reply. Nothing has ever been fixed. When requesting help, I’m limited to entering their selection of the issue message: Renaming a Board. Because I had to choose from their list (“Other” is not included), I know I will receive a canned response on how to edit a board. I have edited boards but this is the first time I’ve experienced this glitch: I could not reorder pins on a board. I made a backup board and moved my pins to it. I DELETED the original board but cannot rename my backup: “You already have a board with that name.” After several attempts I removed and reinstalled the app. I continue to see “You already have a board with that name.” Update: Pinterest responded! Even though the original board was deleted, it takes [2 weeks?] for their system to recognize a new board by that name. However, re-pinning numerous pins to a (temporarily) new board is impractical. One would hope there’s a better solution. One would dare to hope Pinterest reveals it."
"Another major update and more changes that make zero sense.  Why is that camera on the search bar?!?  So frustrating to hit it every time I tap in that space to edit my search.  But my major frustration is WHY DID YOU MAKE IT SO CUMBERSOME TO SEE COMMENTS AND PHOTOS?!?  If i pick comments I don't want to see comments and then have to select again to see more comments. I don’t know who is making these decisions but I have a hard time believing they ever actually us this app. 

Original review: I was happy to see other complaining about some of the changes to Pinterest over time that have become sooo frustrating, but the one thing that really drives me nuts is the search function. I search for something rather specific ""vintage shampoo bottles"" and all I get in return are clothing pins and home design pins.  Nothing at all related to my search? What the hell happened?  It used to be fun to search on Pinterest but I guess I'll have to go back to google image searches to avoid all of your sponsored crap.   If you need money just ask us to pay to remove ads for Pete's sake."
"Where did the all pins section go, and why do these updates happen with no announcement? If this is a bug, then my b — I’ll come back & change this review. It just seems like such a strange and non-intuitive choice to take away the all pins section. There is no longer a way to see your own recent pins (instead you’d have to pick through each board to see what you’ve saved recently) or what other people have been pinning lately. “All pins” section just makes sense, that’s why y’all included it in the UI from the start. It makes it possible for us to navigate and access the content we’re saving, which is the whole point of Pinterest in the first place. 

Though Pinterest is one of my favorite apps, Pinterest’s updates to their UI have been the most frustrating to me of all the apps I have ever interacted with, to be completely honest. The changes never seem tailored to their users at all. I get the consumerist direction Pinterest is going, that’s literally fine by me because it’s understandable. But y’all could at least try a little harder to stay in tune with your user base and their use cases, since so many of these changes in design are tone deaf and completely out of the blue."
"i love how pinterest is focused around what you like rather than your face and who you are. it’s a great way to just express your creativity and is a safe space to find things related to what you love or love to do. anyone can use it and make their profile their own. HOWEVER, they have a habit of making good updates and taking things away right after!! i was once able to make story pins, but my ability to do so suddenly vanished one day with no explanation and they act as if i still have them when i go to sign up again! along with that, i’m not able to choose other ways to react to pins other than with hearts, my home page reverted to an older edition (that was less convenient), and no matter how many times i stay up to date on updates, other people have so many more different options than i do. i know that this is not happening to everybody, but it’s not just me unfortunately. i just don’t like how updates are not equal for everyone when i feel like there shouldn’t be an issue. otherwise, i love this app and highly recommend it."
"Update 2/7/20: now, I can’t even use the app to PIN things, the entire purpose of the app, because the share button is not working, and whatever idiot is in charge of updates also removed the add from website option directly on the app. If I knew of something else like this app, I would use it instead. PINTEREST, you need to look back at how your app was about 2 years ago, and reformat it that way. It was better. People miss it. Every update for the past year has been a change for the worse. 

Ever since the last 2 or 3 iPhone updates, this app crashes every time I go to one of my own boards. If I actually open a pin in my feed, when I go back it refreshes and I lose whatever I wanted to look at next. I’m often hesitant to actually pin things because my feed will show me anything and everything the algorithm thinks relates to it whether I want it or not. They have rendered following boards you like nearly useless, as the following feed is just one big picture after another rather than like a pin board so you can’t really see what’s going on. I’d rather see it in the same format as my regular feed as their pins are what I actually want to see. And FFS can it stop showing me the same crap over and over again after I’ve already said it wasn’t relevant to me?"
"Pinterest is a great place to look at images and find new ideas. However with every update you never know what is going to change for the better or worse. The last couple have been for the better, but before that it seemed like many of the updates took away something I enjoyed about the app unexpectedly. I like the change back to showing who saved each pin on my main dash. I also appreciate the new board sections. I do not mind the picked for me pins to some extent, but I prefer the pins from the boards I have followed. I didn't like it when they changed the way a pin would show how many times someone save a pin from a specific board to all the boards that it has ever been saved to, but I got used to it and it turned out to be better. However taking that away helps no one. I do not care how many times a pin has been saved if I can't see what boards it has been saved to. I would appreciate it if the updates told me what was changing. I don’t like being scared to update because I have no idea when there is going to be another change that will go against my enjoyment of the app."
"This has always been my favorite app, however they are making such a heavy push to minimize it, it’s no longer enjoyable.

My main issue is that I used to be able to see a list of all of my pins in order of most recent (excluding those on secret boards) in one place without having to look at each board. With the new update, I am only able to see recent pins that have prices or links to buy associated with them. This is frustrating and incredibly disappointing. 

For the developers: many people including myself use Pinterest to research items before buying, but when you take away its ability to also be a creative platform to look back through, your fan base will slowly stop using your app. Another frustration is adding sound that cannot be turned off to advertisement pins in addition to taking up 4 pins with of space and making them move. If it wasn’t clear, your users will not buy things they don’t want and spamming their feeds to a point where the app becomes barley enjoyable will not increase your user base, it will deplete it. Make an effort to find balance here, as you’ve clearly lost it."
"I used to love this app. I thought the option to not see certain pins a wonderful idea... if it works !!! I have been getting rid of pins I have no interest in for days at end... I never looked up chicken recipes: I hate chicken ! I never looked up other meat recipes; I’m mostly vegetarian. I don’t care about crochet, and I do not wish to see embroidery patterns. I also never looked for, or have any interest in floral wreath making yet for days I’ve been getting rid of these pins and still they pop up and fill the majority of Pinterest. Why have the option to say you’re not interested in certain pins only to receive them twice as much as before ??!!! Very annoying. Where before I enjoyed getting inspired by all the wonderful pins I now find I’m spending my time on Pinterest clicking that I have no interest in that pin. I also need to see where I can stop Pinterest from spying on me. I will google certain things and when opening Pinterest I find myself bombarded by those exact things I searched for before. Not ok. Just because I looked for a pants pattern ones doesn’t mean I want my feed filled with patterns. Annoying af!"
"I like Pinterest for the most part, but when I am scrolling through and swiping the screen to do so, if my finger touches an add, it opens up instead of continuing to just scroll along. Very annoying! The adds are mixed in with all of the other pins, but they are clearly designed to open much more easily than the regular pins. Regular pins don’t open up accidentally just from scrolling along. This bothers me because of how everything we do on our devices is tracked and recorded so these companies can try to build a history of our interests to try to target us with adds. So When I am unintentionally opening adds that I don’t care about, I am being targeted with adds that don’t pertain to me. In other words, the digital history of what I click on is distorted, and therefore, whoever is collecting this data is not getting an accurate depiction of me. It’s a glitch in the matrix. They are taking the greedy approach and forcing adds onto us that we don’t want, and over time it will mess up their targeting system. This is probably why as a 35 year old male, I get adds trying to sell me products for menopause."
"I love Pinterest, but I’ve noticed lately that whenever I try to save a pin, it doesn’t always recommend the right boards. Like what I mean is I will scroll down my home feed and save like 5+ pins to my Tom Holland board (lol) but then if I save like one Steven Universe pin I have to scroll all the way down to that board because other random boards are recommended for me and save it there. And then if I try to save another Tom Holland pin, it STILL won’t recognize that I’m saving a pin of him and I have to scroooooll all the way down again. I know I probably sound very high maintenance saying this, but around two months ago, I never had this problem. It just appeared recently. It’s still one of my favorite apps, but this has made it sort of annoying. I used to be able to save anything from Lapel Pins, to Steven Universe, to Drawings, to Funny, and they would be the top suggested boards. It’s not like most of my boards are new, which I was thinking may mess up whatever algorithm they’re using because the app needs to get adjusted to that new board. I just don’t know, but it’s not like he problem prevents me from using the app, so I’m good."
"I love Pinterest, but lately my Home Feed is a constant repeat. For example, If I looked up a recipe real quick a week ago, I now only see that recipe, or variations of it. I even went into account settings under history to unfollow it. I’ll click “Seen Pin Too Many Times,” or “It’s Irrelevant to Me.” Or, I absolutely LOVE Halloween, but I have unfollowed my Halloween board, removed Halloween stuff from History, and I still only get Halloween pins. I have done all the updates, closed the app, refreshed a bunch, but my feed is basically me living through the classic “Groundhog Day.”
And all my boards I unfollowed are the only ones I can choose up at the top for ideas. And I rarely see any of the topics I’ve selected to follow, and can it go back to the people/boards I follow are also just on my home page. Instead of scrolling over to the top, and it being one pin that occupies the screen can it please go back to the home page, or at least change it to multiple pins on a screen view like the home page. 

I want fresh when I go onto Pinterest that’s what drew it to me in the first place, I was seeing random things I couldn’t wait to try.  Not 12 variations of a paper moon I looked up for a project three months ago."
"I don’t know how to explain that I LOVED this app back in 2019 when the app was good. But now they’ve added too many USELESS features and layout changed that are frustrating. I liked how Pinterest before used to be very simple and minimalist. They used to have it when on the main feed (home) at the top you can swipe between pins and I loved that till you guys put “watch”. About Watch… it’s really annoying to scroll on your feed and see a cute pin for it to be a freaking TikTok/Reel?!? And it’s annoying that half of my feed is it now. They they got rid of the top feed for this stupid watch. Then they put Pinterest TV which was cool but useless. But I still want the swiping between pins. That brings me to how you moved the alerts/messages to the top right. While all those annoying changed that no one uses you decided let’s make the bottom icons (home,search,post,profile) fill up the bottom. It used to float which was nice. Also the shopping thing is annoying Pinterest has a good shopping platform but they should learn from instagram and see that it doesn’t do well. Obviously every app has to change but these changes have made the app too cluttered and annoying to use."
"listen, i use this app almost daily and i really love the variety of all the content i could find! and one of the latest updates could allow you to switch between two or more accounts, which is all i had wanted for the longest time (i have a school account for projects and a personal one for my own interests). great! right?
but as soon as i switched back to my personal account, the algorithm just GAVE UP on me. it was only makeup, nothing that was from any of my followers, i couldn’t understand what was happening.
i went to my settings and removed “makeup” from my interests (apparently that was the only one i had), thinking my feed would go back to normal and suggest things i liked that were similar to the previous things i saved.
nope.
my feed is now blank. if i want to find content similar to my boards, i’d have to search for similar pins to something i already have. it’s less convenient and i don’t want to reselect the things i’m into. my school account has no problem with this! therefore, i know it’s a bug. please fix it."
"Okay. I’ve had Pinterest on various accounts for the past 5 or so years. I love it, however the update completely killed the purpose of it for me. I used to spend hours adding pins to my favorite boards by using the quick add feature (you know how there was a top bar which you could use to click through your boards and it would suggest pins for it) HOWEVER, Pinterest decided to remove that feature and replace it with a walmart version of tiktok. I miss being able to click through super easily and adding lovely art or recipes. yes, i understand that you can still go to your boards and click the ‘more ideas’ icon, but it’s just filled with videos and not photographs. I understand that pinterest is trying to get the younger targeted audience to attract to it, however i want the old pinterest back! hey, and i’m in the target audience anyway (14). and also, if we wanted to watch tiktok, we would go on tiktok! i go on pinterest to find inspiration to do things and to organize my ideas. anyway, i guess i’m done with my review~ please consider this in your next update. Hopefully my review will go back to 5 stars."
"I have been using Pinterest for years and I love it! With the recent update the was something I noticed that I did not like. When I go to search something and press enter, there is no additional tags after under the search bar like there used to be after looking up something. I really liked this because it could help me narrow down what I would be looking for without having to go back and type additional things for what I was looking for. Now when I search something it seems super bare and boring. If you were to bring this back it would be great! It was a feature I really enjoyed!
Also I can’t see topics I follow anymore, which bums me out, since I can’t no longer click on the topic and see pins for it. I also can’t look up boards anymore which I don’t like that at all. It’s something I tend to do a lot. I also can’t see other boards and topics people follow.  Something you change are great and some are not. I wish you wouldn’t take away features that get used a lot. So please, please, please, some or all of these features back!🙏"
"I love the Pinterest website. I love to cook, and I love fashion. I think it's great to not have to have to thumb through lots of books for great ideas. There's even videos showing how things work. The fashion in men's clothing is great! So much is affordable too! I'm always ready to review products. If there's one thing I really had to do to get things right was the sizing. I so much wanted my shirt I wanted, but it was a bit small, for example. I guess some of the clothes you have to figure the size for yourself. Clothes it seems are a different size if their made in Korea vs made in America. Some things I've seen I don't even have a clue what the numbers indicate, but I have seen both. It may have been my fault not finding another size chart. I learned to be really careful when I order. I do appreciate their making it simple to return items. Anyway, I'm getting better ordering online. Some things do seem to take a while, and if you get the wrong size, we'll ya just ain't happy. Of course no problem with food. Groceries right around the corner. I hope this was helpful. Peace!"
"So I used to love Pinterest but I’m so frustrated right now.  I’ve been emailing their support thingy for multiple days now and the lady is trying to help but she’s either not understanding what I’m saying or can’t help me (bless her heart, she’s trying).  I put my notes from school on Pinterest and one of them got over 600 saves.  I hadn’t updated my app in a while so to check all I had to do was scroll to the bottom of the pin and it said “600.”  But then I made the mistake of updating the app and now I have absolutely no way to view my number of saves.  The support lady told me to make it a business account, which I did, and now I can only see the number of saves within a 90d/30d/7d/24hr time frame.  But no matter what I do, it says 0 saves.  I had 600 saves and now I have 0?! What the heck?  I’ve been asking her multiple times where I can check to see the true number of saves but she keeps avoiding the one question I need answered. I do not believe it’s her fault, I believe the app developers made a bad decision and she has no control over it... so please please please please put the total number of saves back at the bottom of the pin near the comments for personal accounts because I hate having a “business account” and still not being able to see my number of saves.  Okay, that’s all, thanks..."
"I have been enjoying this app a lot, and currently have 8000 pins in 63 different boards/sections. I have been exposed to all kinds of new craft techniques and aesthetic inspirations. Despite the antisocial nature of the app that other reviewers mention, I have found the algorithms to be very useful so long as a suitably descriptive query is used as a starting point. My only complaint is that your tagging functions are absurdly primitive. Because I cannot search for tags by board or section, I do not bother with them. This dampens the ability of my pinboard to be a tailored, searchable image database. But it also limits Pinterests’ overall web traffic, because fewer people bother to add descriptive words to their pins. Why bother? They can’t be queried in any meaningful way. Also, an entirely separate field in the description, solely for tags, would make things even better. Paired with a batch selection tool so I could add tags to multiple photos simultaneously, this would be an ideal tagging system. Seriously, how can you folks neglect something so vital? I hope to hear from someone, I am extending the benefit of the doubt that there is a human on the Pinterest team who reads these reviews regularly."
"Pinterest used to be amazing 1. Ability to like posts, gone why?
2. Privacy settings are a complete lie!  Suggested for  you is on off mode yea right , go back later after doing some pinning or searches and Bam there they go suggesting the things you recently looked at! 
3. Major GRUNT! Why the heck can't they have things in their exclusive category ie: search any ethic group for the sole purpose of interest in said groups items, life styles & things etc and BAM THERES BECKY 
::: hands up emoji::: why? , you can simply put copy cat Becky with her wanna be braids in her own category , hello she's not African anything so why is she there? If the search was black girls with braids! Not girls with braids!  Why the tanning products & Caucasian things &/ or people within every BLACK PEOPLES STUFF SEARCH I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND ! If I looked in opposite category ya might see one person of color and that's a stretch to say the least. 4. Search suggested instead of -pop up stating  to search exactly what you've typed, huh what? Is this nosy app retarded and blind ?!? Might have to tap out , FB, IG, Pinterest etc  everyone's turning into  ppl stalking trash! 5. DO NOT SEND LIKES  POSTS OF THINGS YOU'RE INTERESTED IN ETC TO ANYONE VIA THE PHONE APP THEY'LL HOLD THAT CONTACT HOSTAGE IN DEFIANTLY!  With No way to remove them, next time you click share button there they will be grrrrrr!"
"Warning to users: if you have a Pinterest account and you look at all your boards and everything you’ve placed on them, everything will look just as you wish. If you happen to have another Pinterest account and you log out of one and look at the other one, you will find a bunch of ads inserted  on your boards which you never chose. This means that everyone who sees your boards will also see those ads which is why I have written the following review:  (Pinterest, once a delight, now is all crap and used for advertising only.  If you don’t believe me, look at your account as others see it and you will see what I mean but you have to log out of it and access at it from another account.)

Ads have been incorporated on my boards that I didn’t place there, totaling negating the Pinterest effect.  My personal friends and those I’ve made on Pinterest have complained about this as well and how they were not asked or consulted before Pinterest itself decided to insert ugly these ads  onto their boards (we ARE after all called “board owner”)  without consultation.  Pinterest has decided to become a total dictator by taking out the format and design of subscribers’, thus  taking all pleasure from their usage.  

Yes, indeed, Tumblr is the way to go, at least as it is now."

"Features to be fixed: • AUTO REFRESH: Seriously, every time I leave a tab and go back to it, it always refreshes even if I do nothing. I’ve lost many good finds because of this feature, and it’d be less maddening if you could manually refresh a page yourself. • ARCHIVED BOARDS: I can no longer scroll down tofind my archived boards. The only way I could find them is if I search for them in the search bar! There should be a sub tab in your saved where you can see your archived boards and manage them. Features to be added: • CATEGORIES: I’m pretty tired that I have to manually scroll down a long list of boards just to find the one I’m looking for. It would be much more efficient if you had the option to sort your boards into categories (ex: Inspiration Boards, Art Tip Boards) and not have to delve into the midst of some unrelated boards around it. • BOARD TRANSFER: There should’ve been an option to transfer boards you can edit to another account. I manually have to save individual pins to another account myself. I rely on Pinterest for worldbuilding, and it really bums me out that it is still lacking greatly."
"Pinterest used to be my favorite app, I loved saving ideas to all my boards & keeping stuff organized, but it really has gone downhill the past year. I’d like the ability to search for specific boards back, mostly, and I don’t mind ads, but one every 2 pins is a bit excessive. I hate the “Discover Creators” icon at the top of the home page, along with the new “Ideas from Creators” videos. I know they may be useful for some, but I’d really love if there was a way to hide them. Also, I have two accounts I swap between and lately I’ll be on one account & it’ll show the boards of the other, or vice versa. If I try to go to the actual account the boards belong to, it tells me the account doesn’t exist until I log back in again. Additionally, I can’t reorder my boards anymore. The drag & drop function is totally broken and does nothing, the pins just randomly jump to whatever order they want. Alphabetical order doesn’t work either. I have boards starting with P that show up before J. The new “Your Shopping List” board should have the option to be deleted, or at least hidden from view. Not to mention 8 of them show up at once all over my account. I really want to love Pinterest again, but it’s hard to even use it anymore. :("
"It’s a good app and I would recommend. Just I have a few problems. 
First of all, the constant updates. You don’t need to change the format constantly and it would probably save time to update it less. Like an update every couple of months would be ok or more frequent ones with just bug fixes, but you don’t need to update it every week. It gets really hard to navigate and new users would especially be confused. I myself considered deleting the app at one point because I just got too frustrated. So maybe slow down the updates at least. Recently I also have been having a problem where I can’t see half of my replies to comments. I can’t reply to questions because half of the time the replies won’t open. I can’t see my comments half of the time either. Also on my other device the app won’t let me sign in. I’m going to try deleting the app and downloading it again to see if that works, but other than that I don’t know what to do. If you could fix these issues that would greatly boost my opinion of this app. Thanks :D"
"I have been a pinterest fan since it's inception and I use it heavily to organize my life, ideas, and art! I am really disappointed with the new View Products tag update. When you are viewing a pin, if it has linked products the products are highlighted with dots, feature new tags, and the image itself is grayed out for a few seconds (the few seconds I would normally spend to view a pin.) if I tap the image to make the image appear normally, it opens the website for whatever product is featured. I love saving my ideas and found just clicking on the image if I wanted more info about product purchasing was much more user friendly. This is the first truly annoying feature since the introduction of pinned ads, and I am already using pinterest less because of it. I understand this app is free so ads are a must to keep them in business, but I think many of us would purchase a low cost ad-free version! if there was a paid, ad-free version of the app without the View a Products tag I would be all over it. Please make the View Products tag a settings option we can turn on or off, or make an ad-free, paid version of the app."
"Pinterest was absolutely perfect about a year ago. There was NOTHING wrong with it. Now it’s updated so many times that they really need to fix things that weren’t broken in the first place! With this newest pointless update, I cant see the account that posted a certain pin. Which means, if theres a certain pin that only a certain account uploads, I can’t click on the pin and be brought to the account. It doesnt even say who uploads what anymore! Which is one of the most annoying things ever! WHY DID YOU DO THIS?! Also, why was the ‘Tried’ section and the comment section merged together?? Finally, there’s this glitch where it wont let me see the pins ive recently saved to a board. All the board does is move up to the top of my account but it still shows the time I last saved a pin to that board as 2 days ago. For each board. Which is quite annoying because I have a few references I saved for illustrations I was planning and now they don’t show up!! Pinterest, please fix this. You were an amazing app before this last series of updates."
"After 47 years.......  47 long years ..... After countless attempts prior ......It was finally through this wonderfully created app, Pinterest that led me to meet my birth mom!!!.... I stumbled on a pin back in June 2015 on a lazy Saturday afternoon.... that said Adoptees receive copies of their original birth certificates. This pin began the most memorable journey of my life... I clicked on it and it opened a door that was literally sealed for 40 plus years.... I followed the process from the pin ... received the birth certificate.... began searching for my birth mom .... found her in July 2015 .... not even a full month later.....and met her face to face in November 2015.... unfortunately she passed away December 2016.... But look at the miracle of God I was able spend that  time with her .... Pinterest has been a blessing in my life .... just in time..... and the funny thing is I wasn't doing a search for anything related to adoption... However, God saw fit for me to see that pin... it was the last one at the bottom of the scroll..... thanks Pinterest...keep doing what you're doing!"
"The app has become so horrible. It has become so weirdly reactive. I like fall pictures - pretty leaves and trees. But they represent about 2% of my interests - literally one small board of my 50 or so boards. At some point though, Pinterest started suggesting fall pictures to me, and I made the mistake of pinning some. Now, my feed is 70% trees and leaves, about 28% ads, and about 2% other things. Another example - a few months ago, I was looking at boards of a woman I knew from high school, and she posted a ton of “country girl” sayings, so I scrolled through them. These are of little interest to me, but it was a genre I hadn’t seen and so I looked at them. Didn’t pin one, but now I get emails from Pinterest based on my love of “country girl” pins. What? Last night was the last straw. I went on the app and there was a sweet old poem from my childhood, so I pinned it. (It was about fall of course - see a rant #1!) One pin!! I got on this morning and guess what?! Feed of sweet little poems. I am an early adopter of Pinterest but I find the app unbearable. The online version is better but only because there is slightly more variety and it seems to skew toward my overall interests. Please fix this Pinterest. You were my favorite go-to app a few years ago."
"So I was originally just going to email Pinterest about my problem because it is a very specific problem, but I can’t seem to find the correct email. I even went so far as to go into MESSAGES to find the email. I saw a “Email Pinterest” button in the contacts section of messaging and I clicked it and..... nothing. I click it again..... nothing. It would let me click the button so I just gave up.

Anyways my original problem was with the new update. Everything was fine until this update so I know it’s just the update that caused it. I will go to comment something on a pin and everything will be fine, but when I reply, the “Add” button is like SUPER far down and UNDERNEATH the keyboard. I can’t click it unless I make some really long response that takes up like seven lines and it eventually comes up above the keyboard. And this is ONLY when I reply to a comment. I tried closing out of the app completely and going back in, but it’s been doing this all day and it is VERY annoying. Pls fix this ASAP."
"i love Pinterest so much. i use it all the time when i’m bored or anything. there’s lots of crafts, ideas, recipes and others. on my normal acc i have boards for art, people, hair, makeup, fashion, food, memes and other stuff. On my business account tho i make anime edits so i post my edits on story pins. everything works great and i’m so glad they added story/idea pins. it’s been helping a lot to post edits and it just made pinterest better overall. But since i post my edits on story pins i have to pick a front cover for the story pins and sometimes later on i don’t like the cover or maybe i’m changing the aesthetic for my page and the cover doesn’t match. I would like pinterest make so they let you change your cover of your story/idea pins   anytime! and i think if they did do this everybody would like it much better especially the people who post a story pin and later hates the cover but doesn’t want to delete that pin. Everything other than that is great! i love the app and it’s probably my favorite app tbh :) i’m just waiting for the story pin idea i said to be made"
"I am very happy with some of the updates implemented by the Pinterest team. The sections feature has been a game changer for me! I also think the shopping and explore tabs are handy and I’m sure including shopping features helps Pinterest remain a free service.

However, the shopping tags that appear on individual pins are one of the most annoying features I have ever experienced on any platform I’ve used. They make it nearly impossible to exit an image using the standard swipe method. In addition, they block the image by continually popping up if you accidentally scroll in the wrong spots. Now all this wouldn’t be so bad if they were helpful, but they almost never link to the same product shown in the image. This makes them effectively useless unless you’re in the habit of purchasing something only vaguely similar to what you were originally looking at.

Pinterest is a great service and I won’t quit using the app over this feature, but I would ask that the developers seriously consider if there’s a better way to manage the shopping tag feature."
"As a new small business owner, I got the message that I had to have a Pinterest account and you-must-pin-fifty-times-a-day-and-oh-make-sure-you-schedule-pins-and-oh-you-must-recycle-old-stuff  because it can help you generate traffic. I really don’t see how that can be true. I honestly think the people who give that advice only do so *to* drive traffic to their sites and nothing else. The app is littered with junk, spammy, and downright dishonest pins. It’s stupid. I set up a business account and it’s been such a headache. First, my account was suspended for NO reason. I got an apology about that. Now, my business account is GONE. If I try to connect through a link that someone else would use, I see that all my boards are gone. Pinterest says it’s aware of this problem and that it’ll “take some time” to fix the issue. This was 2 days ago. If Pinterest was such a great search engine like all those blogging “experts” /s claim, how does it go glitchy, even if it’s for some customers, for days and it doesn’t make the news? Imagine if that happened to Google even for 2 minutes. I’m so glad I haven’t ponied up any money to promote any pins. Now, I know that this thing isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. I’m no longer wasting my time with this app."
"Love it! So today I went on my Pinterest to look up pictures of braids and was amazed by something for the first time since I started using the platform. Now, while I am a long time user of Pinterest, for the longest time I’ve complained about not being able to search for the type of people that look like me. That if I were to type in “short curly hair styles” I’d get page after page of white girls. Nothing wrong with them, the pics were beautiful, but just not very representative of me and my hair. This is not to say that I couldn’t find black girls, it just wasn’t easy. I’d have to find one, then scroll to look at similar pics and so on. So back to today, when I typed in “braids” on Pinterest I got the option to choose a skin tone. I nearly cried. This one tiny, simple act of inclusion felt so overwhelming and powerful. All I have to say is, I am more than grateful and so excited to keep using the platform for everything from daydreaming about my future house to choosing my latest hairstyle. Just now with a bit more ease. Thank you."
"I was a huge fan of Pinterest when it first debuted. I went gung ho with creating my pin boards. Several years went by and I had a large following. Sometimes I would get carried away and pin to many pictures from a person that had set limits to how many you could pin. As if they owned the rights to those pictures! Clearly they did not. I had lost my phone, couldn’t remember my login info or my Google info so I was absent from Pinterest for almost a year. I was finally able to get back online and went straight to the Pinterest App. To my surprise I couldn’t log on only to find out that my account had been temporarily suspended. No reason given. I immediately appealed. One year later still no response from anyone at Pinterest. My pin boards meant the world to me, some of them hold many memories of my childhood and when my children were small. Several pictures are on those boards of deceased family members and I will never see those pictures again unless I get reinstated. I can’t believe over pinning gets one locked out of something so personal without any prior warning. I would suggest that other people enjoy pinning but don’t put pictures on there that you would risk losing."
"I love Pinterest. I find all kinds of great ideas for multiple aspects of my life here: food, crafts, parenting, decorating, and even spiritual inspiration. The community is very supportive and has just enough interaction with others to qualify as social media, but not so much as to take away from the ideas themselves. Feeds my creative outlet (and scrolling habit) while minimizing the drama. Plus all the pins I can pull off (let’s face it, not all of them are doable by average untrained folks) make me looks super smart and put together, when honestly I’m just good at using resources and following directions.

I will say this, if anyone is reading these from the developer side: please improve the search functionality. I have so many pins on different subjects that to be able to find them later is kind of part of the draw of pinning. So when it doesn’t work very well, it detracts from the experience significantly. Searchability should be based on the title as well as the description of the pin. Sounds like basic logic but it doesn’t happen often in the app. Thanks dev!"
"I love Pinterest so I can’t rate it one star ever. Lately when I go to pin something from any other app, it no longer automatically brings up boards. You save the pin as a “save” in a non-board “My Saves” board? Boards seem like the whole point of Pinterest?

I’m so glad that we can now reorder, section & move boards & pins, so a heartfelt great job on that.

I used to be able to share & pin something anywhere to my Pinterest in a 2 taps (maybe 4 if I want to choose a different board than the last one I pinned to). Now I share, pin, switch back to Pinterest, go to my profile, go to My Saves, edit pin, choose the board I need and save. I guess I just miss that rather than being up my boards to pin something, Pinterest just automatically throws it in “My Saves” when I pin something unless I bring up my boards. I know it’s small but it kind of multiplies the process of pinning by 3-4x. Now when I go to my Pinterest I also have another task of going through “My Saves” and editing those pins rather than just browsing and being inspired. A big bummer."
"I loved Pinterest so much and used it every day but ever since an update I don’t know how to try a pin or read comments. I don’t know if that’s something that Pinterest removed (in that case I really hope they bring it back because I loved that feature) or if it’s my phone (iPhone XS) or if I’m not looking in the right place for them. Can someone please tell me? I can’t find it in the help section
Three stars

Edit!!!- changed to four stars
I reached out to Pinterest for help over this problem and they immediately fixed it. Like so fast, that the second I was done with the complaint it was fixed. So I’m soo happy about that. Now Pinterest is my favorite app again. The only things I would say could use changing is the inability to move the entirety of other people’s boards onto your own. I forgot my Pinterest account password and email so I had to follow myself and transfer all the pins one by one. Since I have more than a couple thousand pins, this was painstaking and made my fingers hurt. But in other words this is a great app and I am very satisfied with their customer service."
"Why are all the awesome features being removed? I was loving that I could edit and move my boards to organize it all! I wasn’t done yet! Now I can’t rearrange my boards making my profile all pretty. Looks like I would have to do a tedious job of creating and moving the pins separately. I love the sun board/section feature added. But it would be even more awesome of a sub board in a sub-board. That would make my Pinterest life the best in organization! It’s great now we have the introduction of the lightbulb to find more like a particular pin that now replaces the circle thing that was removed. What I found is needed is being able to see who follows what of my boards and profile. Some people only follow a board, so when I delete a board or moved it as a sub board, those people are now gone. Would be nice to have an option to message the people that follow a board that the board was moved and give them the option to refollow the board that was moved or changed or follow my entire profile. Now, that would be awesome! I’m now sadden I can’t move my boards around now. Booo."
"Ok call me “old school” but I’m not the only way who missing how Pinterest used to be. When I was introduce to it, I was hooked...you can tell by how many boards I have. After I joined, one of the first updates for me was so AWFUL I stop using it for a while. Then I decided to give it another chance...I did over & over again but your chances are getting slimmer & slimmer. I dealt with the ads but this new update it TERRIBLE...now we abbreviating the ABCs & in tiny fonts...ahhh, WHY? 
Is it me but did a lot of things shrunk in this new makeover...I haven’t even check on what else been done...I’m like about done already. I agree with others, please make the updates make some kinda sense not just for the few or ones new to the app. Let some else said...at least find out what folks want. Wait a minute...is this a big app joke...messing with people? Ahhh, so not funny. On a positive note, the updates slowed down my time on what use to be an addictive for me. I still use it but so not as “addictive” as it was before. So THANKS for helping me in kicking what used to be a wonderfully creative time & NO THANKS but too late in wishing I passed on this new update."
"It inspires me, many recipes have worked out and tasted great, it shows funny and relatable memes, cool ideas for home decor, aesthetic calming photos, activity ideas, tips and tricks, travel suggestions, not even kidding- education, and basically any content for any interest. Even better, you can organize all this content into neatly filed boards you can customize to your preference and edit whenever you want. You can also communicate with people to share ideas and pins, comment to interact with people as well as give suggestions and help out, report inappropriate content, and in my experience, Pinterest takes care of reported problems right away. It’s so fun and actually helps me with my everyday life by entertaining me, helping me relate to other people with memes when I’m not feeling well, and giving me suggestions for cool ideas that worked. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Only problem is without proper self control, you will spend too much time on this app😂😂"
"In scanning through the recent comments, it seems I’m in the majority. I won’t goin to details because everyone here is saying the same thing, too many ads, content that’s chosen for me based on algorithms that flood my feed with one topic- usually the last thing I searched for, and seriously- what is the point of following other people here? I barely see friends pins show up in my feed. Yes I’m interested in seeing what they pin- that’s why I follow them. All of this has been said in much greater detail here, but the thing that drove me to write this review is the latest update with the stupid freaking dots all over an image I’m trying to look at, so that I don’t miss out on the opportunity to buy it all- problem is, I can’t see it at all because there are white dots in the way! And then when I try to scroll down to see more pins like the one in viewing, which used to be a nice feature, I’m bombarded with more ads! 
The only reason you’re getting to stars is because I wanted to thank you - all the updates have so ruined the app, that I’m spending way less time in my phone now. I’m actually picking up real magazines again- which has been really nice. So thank you, two stars for you."
"I used to use Pinterest a lot. I loved seeing interesting boards and people I followed. Now it’s tons of ads and auto play ads. The quantity of ads ruin the look and feel of Pinterest. I scroll through Instagram all the time and the ads don’t bother me. Pinterest has failed to learn the art of making ads appealing. 

They just bombard you with gobs of ads with that annoying and condescending message about how those ads were paid for. We get how ads work. Having it spelled out every time is not needed. The auto play ads are awful. Just let me turn them off even if I on WiFi. They continue the ruination of Pinterest by ads and take to the next level.

They other major complaint is that I’m constantly inundated with suggestions or content I don’t want at the expense of seeing content I do want. Their algorithms are so off for both advertising and content. I rarely use Pinterest anymore and usually get right off of it after less than a minute because the ads ruin the vibe and aesthetic. Only thing Pinterest cares about is advertising. It’s too bad they could care enough to make the advertising appealing and blended into the aesthetic that made Pinterest so great before. At the rate I don’t use it. I’ll probably delete it soon. Enjoy those ads."
"Click one thing and it thinks you want everything like that.  Click on one bikini and you get the sex channel.  Click on one dog you get overwhelmed with dogs.  Plus no easy way to say “get this crap off my wall and feed”.  If you grew up with a mom who saw you eat a lot of bananas one week then bought twice the number the next week only to see all of them go uneaten, then you might understand that yea I enjoyed the bananas last week but I’m DONE and onto other things this week.  Get a clue moms and marketing people!  I prefer pull, not push marketing.  Put it out there and let me find it.  That’s it.  Since I like bananas I might like x simply doesn’t work for me.  The reality is I already chose my fruit of the week and now I want something salty.  I already bought running shoes and now I need to watch a movie because I’m tired from exercise.  Totally unrelated?  No, not at all.  Think of yin and yang instead of yin yin yin.  Fix the algorithm. 

If you have an addictive personality I guess this site is for you.  But if you prefer to use your own thoughts to search, this firehose of pushing crap your way feels like products jumping into your cart at the grocery.  It’s just not how I search, choose, buy or learn anything."
"I love Pinterest- this app has endless photos and ideas!! If I’m looking for something specific, Pinterest will always have my back. The self promo on here, however, has gotten AWFUL. Almost every single pin I look at has at least a handful of people asking for followers in the comment section. The comments usually look something like this: 

“heyyy i know these are super annoying but ive been working really hard on my account and id really appreciate it if you followed me, ill follow you back!!!” 

On one hand, these people are right, it is EXTREMELY annoying. Since when did anyone start caring about how many followers they have on Pinterest of all apps? I would really like to see the spam recognition algorithm updated to include comments like these because manually reporting them never works and they still show up everywhere; it really takes away from the overall experience since I often open Pinterest to take a break from the chaos of other social media sites. This app is being ruined by the people who are only on here for the follower count. PLEASE do something about it."
"I’ve been using Pinterest since before it was cool, and normally I don’t mind app changes and updates. But this time did me in. I really only want to see stuff from people I follow, and maybe a few pins from similar boards. However, the “following” tab doesn’t show everything my friends pin. And the home page is all, wait for it....., MCU spoilers. Yes, folks. I have gone the entire MCU without having a movie spoiled and along comes Pinterest and suddenly I’m savvy to every Infinity War death. But here’s the real problem. I have spent every day of the past week hiding every Marvel pin I come across, (like, 30 a day) and yet every time I open the app theres still more at the top of my feed. And it’s not just marvel. I’ve been doing a lot of hiding to try and get my feed back to something i enjoy. But it’s the same with other content as well. Instead of giving me less, the app just keeps sending me more of the same. So my Pinterest experience has been reduced to scrolling through the main feed, trying to find my friends’ pins while trying not to read anything else. Cmon, Pinterest. Let’s get back to a tailored Pinterest experience and not what the algorithms want to show people."
"I’m sorry but I came to the App Store, just now from Pinterest, to say that with every update Pinterest seems to be getting worse. Enough already. I’ve been here from the beginning and I flat out refuse to update on my iPad because I realized it just isn’t getting better. I don’t understand why we can’t search within categories like “entertainment,” “pets,” “crafts,” etc anymore... I don’t want a home feed, and then a separate place for people I’m following, that makes no sense.  It used to be much more user friendly.
 Also the “algorithms” or whatever they call it are out of control. I’ll click on one pin for say, cupcakes while in search. And next thing I know I have a million cupcake recipes throwing themselves at me, one after another in my feed. Like, chill out Pinterest. 
One thing I miss is the “tried it” feature. When they implemented that a few updates ago it was great. Somehow they messed that up too with a recent update. Now you can’t simply comment on a recipe without adding a picture or something. My complaint is the new Pinterest is not user friendly. Which is a shame because I love Pinterest it’s my favorite app. There’s really nothing like it."
"What you dislike should be every bit as important as what you Like
And not everything you Like is what you want to spread around and share!

Pinterest has removed key features in its app over the last year that have so severely reduced its personalized uniqueness and usefulness I may as well be on Imgur.  The ability to dislike something (to tailor it out of your feed) for a reason other than a Report Issue (which will only affect that pin, not your preferences) has virtually disappeared, telling the app that you are sick of your feed being overrun by useless/uninteresting/ubiquitous paid advertisements is useless (1:6 pins still an add after a month of hiding every paid add as “I just don’t like ads”), you can no longer “Like” and save a pin that you don’t want to further spread to others resulting in suggested new pins being reduced to the same 100-or-so pins from different feeds (amazingly Pinterest, some of us actually want to _test_ a recipe/troubleshooting tactic/product Before we give a seal of approval and share it with the world!)
But, money and sponsorships are successfully destroying what was once a truly inspired community sharing app."
"Now like everyone who uses this app they have A LOT of boards and each board probably has a lot of saved pins, and I’m sure most people would like to go back and see everything, but whenever they got to see their pins everything is everywhere, I’m sure post people might just wanna have that nice aesthetic organized look. So it is just such a hassle with the current organizing system. For example, whenever I have free time I try to organize my pins so I can find everything, but sometimes I accidentally press the side of the screen when I’m organizing and it taps out of when I was organizing and goes back to how it was originally. THAT IS SO SO TROUBLESOME, I did this like twice after I was organizing the pins for like half an hour. And it just makes me so frustrated, also whenever I’m moving the pins around it is so slow and takes forever for me to organized them. I just would like it so whenever I tap on the side of the screen it doesn’t erase my whole progress or maybe just makes it a draft or something?"
"I truthfully spend way to much time on Pinterest, I have 150 boards and nearly 60k pins. It’s extremely easy to use, a decent amount of organization ability, has plentiful pictures, ideas and products, and not to worry about privacy since it has that too!

The only thing I’ve ever really had a problem with is the limitation on organization/categorization for personal boards. I don’t know if it’s because of the need to save space on Pinterest or even for personal profiles and on the app. But the limitation to only 2 steps in the sectioning pyramid(board and section) can be frustrating.

For example in order to further divide a project from 1 and 2 to 1 and 2 and 3 you’d have to make a new board or overload the board with just more sections. Which while achievable makes a board extremely cluttered. One of my boards as an example on Star Wars, has 116 sections, due to the inability to put a section in a section."
"Please fix the glitch that makes it to where, when you exit the app for just a second (say to answer a quick text), that when you come back, the only thing there is the post you where originally looking at and the rest of the screen black. You can’t even scroll down to see comments or look at the suggestions at the bottom, you have to go back out, maybe to the home page. This is very frustrating and annoying. I love Pinterest and use it all the time, so this is a hinderance and the reason why I’m giving it only 3 stars, when otherwise it would be a 5. I’ll look forward to the next update so this issue can be fixed. 

Also, a suggestion would be to remove the “search” tab and replace it with the “following” tab again. I think it’s wasteful to have a whole search tab when you can search up anything on the other tabs. I liked having a followers tab and think it’s a bit too much to put the home, following, your interest, etc. in one big tab as I like to keep them separate and make use of all my tabs."
"First off, the app has a lot of issues freezing up. I can browse for about 30min and it will lock up requiring me to close it out and reopen it. Checked this issue on several different phones with the same results :( Pretty frustrating to say the least. 
Second, I used to love reading through and searching for random DIY projects and makeovers. However, it sadly seems that most of the creativity and ideas have been replaced by product advertisements and links. For example, when I search for “how to make jewelry” I get 10-15% tutorials and the rest are Etsy and online boutique ads selling jewelry. It seems as if Pinterest has become so dominated by Etsy as well as a few other ads that it’s basically ruined the originality of its app/website. 
With that being said, I understand some people search Pinterest for shopping ideas so maybe it would be helpful to just update the search to better recognize clue words “DIY”, “Makeover”, “redo”, etc. that way it can prioritize any ads to the very bottom of the list. ??? I don’t know much about computers but I do know I don’t like where Pinterest is heading."
"Well I love Pinterest, but lately a lot of content has redirects that take one to dead ends or to un related content when trying to follow feeds. But my one real issue is that when trying to enlarge a picture or page, the page locks up and I have to completely close out the app and then restart the app and then try and re-find the lost pin. OR, if I am afraid of a freeze up I have to save it so I can get back to the particular pin I am interested in. Which forces one to save a lot of junk that I don’t want to save, just to look at. This has been a problem for at least 5 or 6 iterations of updates. I know I am not the only person that faces this issue. Then trying to find a way to report this issue through there web sight is almost impossible lol. I wish they had an easy to find ( report issues with the app ) feed on there web sight. I hope some one from the app developers department see’s  this and contacts me. So they can either fix the issue or identify if the problem is me and not the app and that I am ether not operating the app correctly or if the resolution is in front of me and just don’t see it."
"Ok so I completely and totally LOVE this app, but one thing I’m confused about is story pins, I have a business account but I can’t email Pinterest (I got locked out of my email) and I don’t know when story pins will come out. But other than that mess I love the app.

Edit: Ok, so yes I still love this app but i’m not the happiest. Ive tried numerous times today and yesterday to log back into my account via apple id. Its not working. I aswell am not able to get acess to my email because of previously stated reasons. I dont know if its just the apple id feature or if I got hacked or something. No changes have been made to either of my accounts so Im quite confused. If I could find out how to get it back that would be lovely, thank you.

Another edit in the same day lol: Im good, I got back in, but I hate the fact that everytime I go from my personal account to my business account and try to go to my personal again, it logs me out. It’s irritating and I also switch my accounts often."
"I’m giving the app five stars so that this review will not be ignored. This app is so amazing except, well, it’s getting buggy, and very centered around money. My problem is with the “shop your look” and “your shopping list” boards. One is fine, that’s an ok feature I guess, but 40!? Suddenly, since mid-May, on different accounts (I’ve made two new ones in an attempt of FIXING THIS) these “shop your look” and “shopping list” boards appear and add up till there’s nearly 100 and I can’t delete them. They’re so ANNOYING. If I want to buy something I’ll buy it, but I don’t need so many glitchy boards I can’t get rid of clogging my profile. PLEASE fix this. So many people complain about the issues with this app and developers never listen. If you don’t begin taking accountability for the things you’re changing and ultimately ruining, you’re going to lose your app to anyone not interested in selling a brand. But do you even care? I doubt it. RIP Pinterest"
"Love this app, but have noticed an annoying feature. When tapping on a pin, you are linked to a website, but almost every time I go to scroll down on the website to continue reading, it closes the site and takes me back to the pin. The sensitivity for closing a site by sliding up is way too much. It could either be lowered, so that it doesn’t mistake scrolling for trying to get back to the pin, or maybe go back to just hitting the “x” at the top to get back to the app. I love the updates and how the company conditioned to try to improve, but this problem quickly destroys all patience when you’re trying to read something and have to continue to scroll and find it because it thought you wanted off of the site and back to the pin. I know it does this mostly if you try to scroll from the bottom or left side of the screen and not if you used your right hand to scroll, but I am left handed, and myself and many others use our left hands (and thumbs) to scroll through pages and apps."
"Don’t get me wrong, I love Pinterest. I am on it everyday and it’s really helped me find new things I never would have thought to look for before like recipes, costume ideas, makeup ideas, hair ideas, and naturally I’ve planned my dream wedding on a hidden board! Why did I give it three stars though? Glad you asked, just as I’ve mentioned above those were things I never thought to look for, a lot of them I just so happen to stumble upon on the discover under certain groups (like beauty for example). Since the discover has been gone it’s been a bummer to go on Pinterest. I don’t always have something I want to search for, and if I do the same search twice I get the exact same pins as before so I’m not discovering anything new. I know there are suggestions based upon my searches and what’s trending, as well as the home screen shows me things related to those searches, but ONE time I saved something riverdale and that’s the only thing that has been popping up for weeks! I just want the good old days of the videos of the day and the discover to find new content I wouldn’t have looked up otherwise."
"An app so ridiculously great...it did not force my thumb over a topic to create as a board when I already have rich and popular boards I have made myself. I also want an app that let us really, really get rid of some pins when we say go away. Also let us have some better filters for safety.  And...Space for artists and photographers to create and add quickly? Just brainstorming now. The app is fast and straight forward.

I do need something though. I need to be able to flip back more easily to a certain selection of the suggestions that first pop up, as they erase something I spotted but cannot find again because the suggestions were refreshed. Being able to have pathing that tracks how you got to pins, how you have been exploring might be a good tool to find your spot or spots after backing out of a certain selection of similar pins  and the similar pins before that. I can get lost in this are with similar pins, but I want to be able to go back in down a path of similar pins as easily as I can back out simply to the first pin I saw."
"I never would have updated my app if I’d known they would remove such a vital function.  Even on mobile web browsers, the function is gone, and requesting the desktop site does nothing to remedy this.  For months I’ve been regularly updating the app in the hopes that the option will have returned, to no avail.  Please bring the Search Boards option back!  What is the point of people being able to create public boards if no one is actually able to find them??
Also, I’ve noticed that Pinterest has gradually been showing more and more product posts during searches instead of standard user content as far as I have been able to tell (not ads *by technicality* since they’re posted as standard posts, but all anyone would have to do is move them over to under the Shop umbrella and they absolutely would be), and this makes it tedious to find what you’re looking for when you’re just trying to find design/aesthetic inspiration, not product ideas.  I feel like it must be a change to the algorithm or something.  This is incredibly frustrating since this is what the Shop function is supposed to be for."
"I have used Pinterest for YEARS and I have always loved the content that can be found on this platform. I think it is a great space to share creative ideas and niche interests with others and I really appreciate what Pinterest stands for as a company. However, I don’t know what is the issue with this app now because it used to run so smoothly, but in the past year my app has started to crash constantly, almost every other time that I come across an ad pin. The ads themselves don’t bother me and I don’t even really mind the fact that they come with multiple pictures (unlike most pins that I see on the site) but almost every time I encounter an ad my app completely crashes and I have to reload it. I have a similar problem when I click on a pin to visit the website. Often Pinterest will try to reload the website over and over for no reason to the point where I can’t scroll down on the web page or read the content that I clicked on the link for. This app has become very frustrating to use and a few simple bug fixes could make it so much better."
"WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE INTERACTIONS OF THIS UPDATE?! Hey— Senior UX person here— GETTING TICKED OFF at the new interactions. If I tap a picture, I should expect the same interactions EACH TIME. Top right action should never change— this is usability 101. Is it save or is it follow?? Stop prioritizing sponsored accounts— or whatever reason this button changes each time. Your last update (guessing where you’d save the pin and reducing taps) was amazing. With this update, I have to keep unfollowing accounts I’ve incidentally followed because the save button keeps moving. Please do better! Revert back to something that saved time and allowed for more mindless pinning. The new sticky save bar obstructs the image. Plus, there are so many bugs with the ‘sticky’ save bar— like when an option to follow on Instagram is more prioritized than saving pins (sticky save doesn’t even appear). This app is made for organizing ideas, not pushing instagram accounts. Why did you make saving pins harder? So frustrating. Wish I didn’t update. Also.. just from a CSS perspective- why are your primary CTAs different shapes and sizes? How many app styles did we slap together?"
"I really have not liked the changes Pinterest has made to their platform over the last 3 to 4 iterations. I don't like not being able to like other people's pins--it completely removed any nod toward being a ""social"" media platform when it did this. When I liked something, it was usually because I appreciated what my friend had pinned and I wanted them o know I saw it and liked it--for them, not for me. If I like it for me I would have pinned it also. I despise the constant bombardment of ads in the feed. No matter how many times I change my settings, send feedback on spammy ads, or completely block ad promoter, the ads still keep flooding in. With so many ads, it compounds one of the more recent issues arising from changes--you can't see who has pinned something without first clicking on it, so now you're sucked even deeper into the ad nonsense. If I didn't have so much stuff pinned already, I would not sign up for it. As it is, I mainly use Pinterest for recipes and ideas.  I am in the process of moving my recipes out to a different platform so I won't have to interface with Pinterest. Just a bunch of bad moves on their part. One. Right. After. Another."
"The updates every week don’t polish the app. They’ve only been making it worse but I have a few requests that I will be taken into consideration. Whenever you upload your own pin, it only allows you to choose from the most recent photos on your phone and you would have to scroll up to access the older ones. Many children, teens, and adults alike have tons of photos and maybe even folders for them, so it would be much easier if the app allowed people to select pins from different albums/folders in their photos. Secondly, I cannot seem to be able to upload gifs or videos so that would also be a lot more helpful for users to share videos/gifs saved in their photos. I still like the app, though I think there are many more potential qualities the app could have to become better and grow!! Thank you for reading and have a lovely day!!

Edit : Just after going back to the app, it continuously crashes. I'll open it and it begins to load then it will turn black and return to my wallpaper."
"I’ve had Pinterest for a few years now and I honestly love it. The newer changes, “likes” as a board and “hide the pin” when you hold down on it don’t make me happy. Sometimes I just wanted to like a pin and keep scrolling but I can’t do that now; I have to post it to the like board and if I’m going to do that I might as well put it in one of my own boards. 

The “hide the pin” thing drives me absolutely nuts. I hold down to send the pin to a friend and accidentally slide over the “x” and it’s hidden and there’s absolutely **nothing** I can do about it!! I liked it better when you could choose, not automatically hide it. Before it would ask why you wanted it hidden so it could compare that to other pins you wouldn’t want to see. 

Otherwise I love love love my Pinterest. I wouldn’t delete it over these small issues but I’ve talked to friends with Pinterest and they have the same two complaints. If these two problems were fixed I would have no problem giving it 5 stars but they make enough of a difference to rate it 4 stars."
"Pinterest has been one of my favorite apps for years. As a person obsessed with fashion, art, cooking, etc, Pinterest has been perfect place for me to get ideas and see what people are making. However, I think one of the most recent updates has made Pinterest loose part of its charm and it’s a pretty awful change, all things considered. Of course, I’m talking about the removal of being able to comment photos on pins. Having the option to share photos was wonderful, I especially loved it for crafts or recipes because you could see how things went for other people who tried it. It felt like it gave Pinterest a charming little community of people sharing what they’ve done with others. When the update took that away, it’s made Pinterest feel hollow; it makes Pinterest feel like it’s not about sharing ideas with a community anymore which kinda goes against what the app was designed for if you ask me. Overall, it’s a really disappointing change and I wish they would bring it back. Do better, Pinterest or you’ll loose your user base with these regressive updates :/"
"*They fixed it I guess with the last update and I couldn’t be more please with the app again.  It’s amazing for finding quick diys and it’s once again easy to find, save, and organize them on the app.  I would highly recommend this app to anyone who is every in need of ideas for anything at all.  I’m going to keep my original post still up on here just in case they update it again and it goes back to being all messed up lol*

I love Pinterest so much and have been using it for years with no problem.  I don’t know what’s up with the last update but every time I go to pin something it immediately goes to a “Quick Saves” board.  In the past, I was able to just save it to the board that I wanted but now I can’t even do that and when I push the “change” button, it won’t even let me put it in a different board/section (it just stalls up).  It’s not the end of the world but it’s pretty inconvenient."
"I've been using Pinterest for several years and have always enjoyed it. However, in recent times I have found that the app is rather a little boring or not as fun to use. I think for it to be a better app again, Pinterest needs to bring back the like button for all pins rather then just for group boards or not at all, instead of the posts for the following section it should be more like the home page of Pinterest where you see the recommended pins, normal and business profiles should get the option for users to upload a profile cover photo, Pinterest needs a couple big different options for a dark mode like a dark blue or grayish black, Pinterest should have a different section for posts that are in the following section, the explore section needs to be how it used to be and Pinterest also needs a better system for reporting posts since sometimes posts that actually don't violate Pinterest's rules get taken down. Other then what I afformentitioned, it's a good app but needs major improvements including what I previously stated."
"Well not really, but there was a really wholesome thing they did, that I was not aware they do. Not only is Pinterest my go-to to get my creative juices flowing; it’s also my only form of social media. I get the latest memes, whilst getting deep and creative. I love how customizable it is to your tastes and I’m always finding new stuff. Great for artists, and literally whatever else tickles your pickle.

 Back to curing my depression though, when you have a hard day...or life, sometimes you just need to stare at some depression memes. Pinterest did supply, but they also (by my surprise) had a Pinterest Health Center. It had the suicide hotline, along with different sections of inspiring words. It’s hard to explain, just look up depression memes.

 But I don’t want this to be overlooked, I’m so happy they took the time to acknowledge mental health problems and direct people in a different way to get themselves help. It means a lot to me that they did this, even made me feel better. Thank you Pinterest :)))"
"This is a good app, but there’s always something that’s broken every time there’s an update. It usually affects the comments. This time there’s no way to access the comments on anything other than a board with multiple people in it. There also isn’t a way to see a pin’s original pinner unless, again, it’s on a group board. It’s not this specific glitch that makes the app only three stars, but just the fact that there’s always something. In one of the other more recent updates, whenever you tried to like a comment while typing your own, the app would crash. A while ago, before the format of the comments was changed, 50% of the time you wouldn’t be notified if someone commented on a pin you also commented on. In short, it’s not the glitches themselves that make the app bad, it’s the fact that there’s always something wrong, being a major inconvenience. It only lasts about two weeks, but as soon as it’s fixed, something else is wrong. This app needs to step up its game, and if it doesn’t, I’ll likely stop using it."
"I watch a show on bariatric gastric bypass surgery. I decide to look the surgery on my browser to gain more information. I suddenly start receiving ads on Pinterest to receive bypass surgery. I am not 600 pounds nor do I need gastric bypass surgery. How did Pinterest know to show me these ads? I see no language in the settings to change the fact that Pinterest is collecting my search and browsing data over multiple platforms. Unacceptable. I have cross-site tracking set to off on every platform. I’ve resorted to using Pinterest on a private browser. Update: I looked up children’s sunscreen in my phone’s browser. Guess what showed up on Pinterest? Coppertone ads. Cross-site tracking is still off. Pinterest, you are violating my privacy rights. 

My feed is overrun by topics “selected” for me. If I search for one thing I suddenly have almost the entire feed taken over by that topic. Why can’t the feed show me what my friends post anymore? That was why I joined Pinterest. Now, I only see tailored ads that are repetitive and irrelevant."
"Good LORD it’s a wreck! Videos are super annoying! I want to click a pin and be taken to a website! Links added in the comments for a website are inactive to iOS users, AND we can’t copy/paste! I detest that it is getting even LESS user friendly. It’s difficult now to find the individual boards of a user, I want to go to their profile and see their boards displayed individually.  I DO NOT WANT YOU TO SUGGEST PINS FOR ME!!! The ads are out of control. Pinterest app has been going downhill for quite some time. I haven't complained until now. I don't know who is tweaking the app with all these ridiculous updates but you need to STOP! They have no idea what Pinterest users want. Removing the like button was the last straw. Then you messed with our notifications and made them obnoxious, confusing and hard to read. The spam is OUT OF CONTROL! It’s even in my messages. I clicked a stupid ad when scrolling by mistake and my personal information was hacked. The ONLY thing I use pinterest for now is searching MY OWN pins for recipes and websites to refer back to. I’ve recently started searching the web and saving recipes and websites in my bookmarks, who needs this circus!"
"Pinterest has come a long way from what it used to be. Some of it was for the better, but for the most part it’s just gotten worse. I’ll have random pics come up and I’ve never searched for them before and when I just ignore and keep scrolling hoping that maybe they won’t show me another pic if I don’t do anything with it, they flood my feed with either the same or other pictures like it. Like for example: SZA. 

Never listened to her music a day in my life nor do I care to, but she pops into my feed so often you’d thing I have a board solely dedicated to her. I don’t, but Pinterest seems to think I do. Even if I block the picture it’ll say something thing like “Got it! You won’t see this again.” but like 2 minutes later it’s just a different picture of her. I’ve unfollowed nearly everyone to see if that was the issue, but it’s not. So I’m stuck with SZA forever I guess…

And I’m not sure who decided that Profile Saves would be a time saver, but they were wrong. The feature is annoying. Just bring the old Pinterest back or at least have an update that negates the newest update."
"lately i’m having this problem where pinterest keeps putting random pictures and articles in my feed that i never search for such as writing articles (i do have a board about writing but the stuff i saved was very different from the writing articles it recommends me, wedding photos, random images of stuff like hardware or whatnot, and just some stuff that i genuinely cannot explain for my life. i always press not interested and then it’s irrelevant for me which works for a while, but then after two mostly regular visits, they’re back. i do have the app in multiple devices so it could be my sister or mom but i know they would never search that kinda stuff, also my mom has her own account, doesn’t use my devices, and i don’t even think my sister has a pinterest. i’m really frustrated and i genuinely have no idea why this has been happening for the past few days but i’m hoping it stops soon, ive considered making an entirely new account which i really don’t wanna do because i’ve used this app for a good three years and i’ve made A LOTTA boards with A LOTTA pins in them."
"Hi, first of all I’m going to say this is by far my favorite app to find new ideas and inspiration! I’ve had Pinterest for a pretty long time and possibly even a few accounts over the years. I just wanted to throw my idea out that it should be easier to follow people from their pins posted directly on the home or explore pages. My concept is that when IOS users hard press on the pin to enable the quick option bubbles when the “more” option is chosen that not only “report pin” is shown, but also “follow user”, or something of that sorts. It would make following and connecting with other Pinterest lovers not only easier to access but easier to gain followers yourself! Nothing feels better than the notification that someone saved your pin & has the same taste as you. Hell, it might get y’all more users too! (Also consider allowing users to customize their profile, home, and explore screens with different backgrounds or accent colors) xoxoxo"
"I love Pinterest for curating ideas and images. The new feature of boards within boards makes for easier and more effective organizing. I had long been wanting to be able to reorder pins within boards and was excited that feature was added to the website, but it doesn’t seem to be in the app. I find less and less good content through the feed though as time passes. It reminds me of a traditional magazine that is mostly ads with a few articles throughout. The feed is overrun with ads I don’t care about and I’m getting bored of the pins that are being suggested for me. I don’t want my friends’ pins buried in the notifications section; they used to be in my feed and made the feed more interesting. Also, I HATE the suggested search terms that are in bold rainbow colors at the top of every board. I never click on them and would never need a term suggested to me. I can think for myself. It’s a useless and annoying feature and messes with the aesthetics of my boards. Overall, I still like and use the app, but I’m using it less often than I used to."
"I honestly love pinterest and i’ve been using it for about 7-8 years (i’m not sure exactly). and it provides the content i want but i have a really big issue with one of the updates a while back and i really wish for it to be changed back. you used to be able to like pins and then on your feed stuff similar to what you liked and pinned would pop up. and it was really good to keep seeing stuff you liked but didn’t have a particular place to section it. it even made its own little “pinterest likes board” so you could still access them. but for whatever reason they took it away. i tried making my own “like” board but it tries to find the consistency in the posts i like and it doesn’t work really well. please bring back the like button, i know there is many people who miss it and i doubt many would have a problem with it. i love the app but i would probably spend more time (like i used to) on this app if it had the like button again. thank you!"
"I thought it was great to find that Pinterest had an app. I’ve been addicted to Pinterest for several years. What I don’t like is that if I use the app I can only look at one page at a time. No tabs! So, I’ve gone back to the browser interface. It’s maddening not to be able to follow more than one pin without going to one pin, then going BACK to the page where you saw something else, that is, if you remember by then (and by then it may not be there once you do go back). 
Also, I agree with other comments that there are now way too many ads, and that is negatively affecting Pinterest. It is very much like when you are problem solving or daydreaming and some errant, unrelated thought pushes it’s way into your mind... but in this case those unwelcome and often unrelated topics just keep coming between you and your visual experience, and it is quite disturbing. Especially when they are flashing videos. I think Pinterest is making a mistake in not protecting the user experience, which is what keeps us coming back. Pinterest, you have something unique. Don’t cheapen it."
"Over the years, Pinterest kept screwing with all the fun elements of the app and it’s not nearly as awesome as it used to be. It’s way more commercial, filled with ads in the form of “targeted pins” that appear in your feed, often wildly inappropriate, like a maxi pad pin on a food board. It’s annoying. The way pins are displayed keep changing too, getting smaller with the increased ads until few if any words are even displayed, forcing you to slow down to open each pin to read the description, which bogs down the entire site. Sometimes it’s agonizingly slow. Pinterest used to display the entire text on boards. Now it’s like the site prefers you to write nothing, just pin, pin, pin! The algorithms have changed on emails too, as have he ones that used to allow you the trace the pin back to the original. All gone. It makes the site a lot more boring. However, it is still useful as a virtual bulletin board, which was the original intention. The rest of the stuff just makes me spend way less time on Pinterest, which is probably better."
"What the heck are you doing to your own app!? What is this “unorganized pins” section? Whenever I click “save” it no longer brings up the board options like it used to. There was no issue with this but you still had to change it. Now when you click “save” it automatically saves it to the unorganized board instead of bringing up the list selection. what the heck. Stop making the app so annoying. There is no reason that the pins should automatically save to this section. Unnecessarily, annoying, and just an overall horrible decision. Fire whoever came up with this idea. Oh, I also found out that you took away the ability to reorder my boards. WHAT THE HECK! Stop making this app horrible and aggravating. Let me do what I need to do. Stop making it complicated, taking away features, and saying it’s improvements.

update: the unorganized pins went away but you know how it is. with every pinterest update comes another pinterest glitch. now my home page will not refresh. i have to swipe to refresh it at least 3 times before it works. sometimes it doesn’t work at all. i have a good internet connection too. FIX YOUR APP!"
"Ok, I have been using this app for over 5 years now. I understand some of your policies, catering to the masses and you made some changes; then more changes and now you allow people to use their own opinions to judge another’s opinion and repot them for conspiracy theories? Umm hello, where’s the First Amendment? Oh just in case you forgot , that’s free speech or freedom of speech, how technically do you any to get? .…ok, but one of my biggest problems is there’s no way to contact anyone. Your little link you got posted for the web is the same as in the app. Not helpful at all. I have a question about your ads. I understand you need to run ads because it’s a free app, ok fine, but do you have to play audio with the ad? It’s very freaking frustrating trying to listen to my music and have it get shut off every single time I come across one of the many video ads. I’m mostly writing my complaints here because there is no other option! I’ve looked and looked and there absolutely no way to contact anyone. App Market has now become tech support."
"When I first got Pinterest, many years ago, it was a great way to find personal interests and fun ideas from other users and sites. It’s now turned into online ads, and un-useful suggestions. Search for one topic or click on a post and suddenly your feed is overloaded with those searches that are no longer relevant. There needs to be a better way to customize suggestions and specific categories need to be brought back to more easily search for what I want. The second you allow advertisers and algorithms to suggest things on your feed, the less free the app surfing experience is. Sure it may be more personalized, but it limits the ability to explore different corners of the world and what it has to offer. You get stuck in your own personalized bubble of advertisements made specifically for you. Just because I looked up a bread recipe a month ago, doesn’t mean I plan to become a professional baker, with 100 other bread recipes clogging up my feed. I don’t even explore the Pinterest feed anymore for these reasons. I just keep the app for the things I’ve already saved. Huge letdown."
"I used to love the Pinterest app but it is overflowing with ads now. For every 3 pins there is an ad trying to sell products to you. It’s very annoying. It’s even getting to the point where you see more ads then pins now.
Update: dropped to 2 stars. Since the last update the feed does not load past a certain point. I am getting more ads than ever. It is clear Pinterest has monetized (or something) for businesses, which are completely irrelevant to me and my interests. I get this girl is trying to sell her fake eyelashes, but Pinterest you are doing her no favors. I don’t even wear make up! I’m sick of seeing tik tok videos too. I don’t have tik tok and do not want it. Otherwise I’d be on that app.  I am getting an increased amount of pins in languages other than my preferred and am getting tons of wedding and baby pins. Neither of which I am interested in. I’m already married and have no future baby plans. I have attempted to “hide” a lot of these stating “not interested” “not my language” etc but they never stop. Getting pretty close to deleting the app. It’s a hunt to simply find a pin I like anymore."
"This app has worked perfectly fine for me for over a year and a half, but now Pinterest is just more of a headache. For example, when you follow someone on this app, it shows that you are following them and usually sends them a notification, as well as their feed shows up on your home page. However, something has gone wrong with my app, and it does neither of those things. Now, when I follow someone, it doesn’t show that I am following them nor does their feed show up on my home page. If I click on someone that is following me, it doesn’t show in their following that they are following me even though they are. It is extremely frustrating because not only is my homepage stopped refreshing with new ideas from different people that I have followed, but I am losing followers on Pinterest as well. I have contacted Pinterest help and have done everything they have suggested to do to fix this issue, and nothing has helped. PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM!"
"To say I am disappointed in this app is an understatement. I used to love this app to save my favorite quotes and recipes but now I am contemplating deleting it. I was throughly disappointed when I found that my pro life pins were censored to say “pro choice”and even  pornographic in my recommended section. After asking around I found that many other people were experiencing this issue and were very upset, angry, and frankly fed up. To categorize an entire movement dedicated to protecting those who cannot protect themselves as “hateful” is disgusting. Furthermore I have seen no action taken against the hateful, offensive, crude comments left under pro life posts. Your  app has clearly shown their stance on this issue and made it known to the public. I understand that you are allowed to have your opinion and speak your mind, and I respect that. However, while you exercise this  freedom, I encourage you to remember that I have that same freedom. So, just because you disagree with the pro life movement, does make it acceptable to shut down conversation.I hope to see a change soon and in the meantime I will fight for the unborn. These kinds of things do not weaken pro life people, it only makes us come back stronger.
-regards, Emily"
"I have loved Pinterest for years, but recently they have made is so ads (which are already irrelevant) can play incredibly loud sounds/music as you are scrolling along! It has made me avoid using Pinterest for most of the day. I can’t use it when I’m near people or in bed, or basically anywhere because I have to turn off my phones sound. I don’t want to forget to turn it back on or I’ll miss a text, alarm, or call. I like to spend all my free time scrolling through Pinterest, but since I have to edit my settings every time I use it; I don’t use it. I’m too nervous I’ll accidentally forget to turn my sound back on and miss something. I have tried to find a way to edit it in the settings, but nothing seems to work. The videos that are a part of pins are silent unless you click them. They cause no issues, but the ads don’t follow the same protocol and have created quite a problem."
"I LOVE Pinterest because it’s not like any other social media platform such as Twitter, Snapchat, and/or Facebook. Pinterest is like a digital magazine that you can look up anything such as inspirational quotes, recipes, fashion, creative arts, humorous posts, and cultural sharings. The only thing I don’t like about Pinterest is how it has the option to “following” or viewing “followers” on your profile, but it’s not as dangerous as any other social media platform that makes you want to transform into something you’re not. Pinterest is a great social media platform that encourages you to look up ideas and common interests with other individuals from what they share which motivates you to embrace your beautiful and authentic self. I strongly recommend other individuals to quit Snapchat, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook and to get the wonderful app known as Pinterest. Ever since I’ve quit all the other social media apps and downloaded Pinterest, I’ve been much happier and healthier."
I’ve recently updated the Pinterest app on my phone and the one thing I CANNOT STAND about this update is the lack of letters when I’m saving pins. Before this update when I would go to save pins it would pull up like top 3 boards I might potentially save it to and then below that all of my boards in alphabetical order with the entire alphabet on the far right side. Where if I knew the board I wanted to save it to started with the letter U I could click the letter U on the alphabet list on the right and it would take me to the beginning of all my boards starting with the letter U. Why the developers thought this was a good thing to remove I don’t know but as someone with easily 50 boards that was a very helpful tool for me and I’D LIKE IT BACK PLEASE!!! I spend far too much time on Pinterest and can easily save and go through 100 pins a day so ease of access when saving pins is a must for me and I hate the new way we have to save pins. It’s impractical and obviously wasn’t designed for people who have a lot of boards. So please put it back the way it was.
"I’ve used pinterest for years and I love the app, but for the past few months or so (at least, that’s how long I’ve noticed it) the app will...freeze sometimes? I’ll just be scrolling and then go to press my profile button and realize that I’m not able to tap any of the buttons on the bar at the bottom. It won’t unfreeze unless I close the app tab out and then open the app again. Thought it was because I needed to update, but my app is fully up to date so that’s not it. Hopefully it’s not just me!

Also, I find that while most of my boards show the “more ideas” tab (which I love for finding similar pins), some of them just don’t have that tab and I don’t know why. Again, not sure if it’s just me or not, but still would like this to be fixed or would like to be told how to fix it!

(Also: I think sub-sections would be a great addition to boards! I love the option to add sections already, but I wish I was able to add sections to those sections.)"
"I love Pinterest. I use it daily for both work and pleasure. Lately I have felt that both the functionality and the search have really declined. My searches bring up so many products that it feels as if I’m using the Google Shopping tab. One of the best features of Pinterest was that through community, you were able to find users and boards who shared your aesthetic. By removing the option to view other boards that a pin lives on, it’s virtually erased the ability to discover other verticals and users to follow. I understand that you are trying to promote your own search algorithm, but frankly it will never be as good as my own aesthetic reasoning. It’s so hard to research now and such a frustrating loss. 

A few months ago I saw a segment on Chelsea Handler’s Netflix show where she discussed the future of tech and AI, and he made a point that it was important to not lose a level of human connection with all these platforms that we use on a daily basis. The loss of features that make it easier to find like-minded boards and followers really destroys the sense of community on Pinterest. I don’t want it all dictated by algorithms."
"I love Pinterest and I never leave reviews so thats how you know its bad. I have had the same issues for months and every update only makes them worse. Firstly, while opening the app or clicking on pins sometimes the screen freezes and the only way out is to close the app and open again. Wouldn’t bother me if it didn’t happen multiple times while using the app daily. I have an iPhone XR if that matters at all.
Secondly, when going to pin something my recommended bored are never the board that that particular pin belongs in. They used to suggest my recipe board when pinning food (and I understand they aren’t accurate some of the time) and now every pin it seems to disregard and I have to scroll through my hoards of boards to find the one I’m looking for. Sometimes, they’re not even in Alphabetical order so I give up and pin it to my old likes cause I give up.
Little annoyances start to add up, especially when the ads always seem to be working fine. If you can push ads in our face you can at least give us a decent app that works how it’s supposed to."
"I’ve been using Pinterest for so long.. like 7+ years. 
This app has helped me stay organized and gain new ideas to strive towards. I’ve always loved this app. However, the bugs that I’m dealing with on it have been making me upset for awhile now. There are wonderful features that allow you to organize your boards into sections so it’s not so messy and I love that. I also love that I can order the boards into a fashion that makes me feel put together. Lately I’ve noticed my boards keep moving on their own. When I try to reorganize them they pop up 3 boards higher than where I’ve placed them. Or if I move them down more than just the board I’ve attempted to move has moved around. I also hate that there’s a board for all pins that I can’t get rid of. The all pins board is redundant. Last of all, the shopping board is also a board I can’t get rid of. it’s very bothersome to me to have boards I didn’t ask for on my page, it feels like an ad I can’t hide."
"I absolutely love Pinterest. I use it daily for multiple things. I updated it yesterday and I can no longer leave comments which is upsetting! I have tried on multiple pins and I cannot do not matter how short or long the text is. 

Also I cannot stand the new “have you tried it section” it was a great idea in theory but so many dang kids and lazy adults who aren’t paying attention are turning it into another comment section. 95% of the time you can’t truly find out if someone has tried it and been successful. It’s filled with pics of people (why I don’t know) and spam message. I think it’s time to pull that feature. Maybe just have two or three buttons for those who tried it to rate their success with it but make it clear it’s that’s what it’s for. It could be like a thumbs up or down. Or colored buttons. 

Please fix/update and I will change my rating. I really do love this app and how it will continue to grow and get better. Just remember simple is best with this app and it works great that way so don’t over think it. Thank you Pinterest team!"
"I find myself having to log out and back in so often just to get features to work. Very annoying and inconvenient. Also the way you have to switch profiles is soooo annoying. You have to switch to your personal account then switch account and then switch the that accounts business account and all over again to switch back. This is so tedious for someone that runs multiple business accounts. Needs major improvements for the iPad.

UPDATE: Had to come remove a star since I cant even create a pin without restarting my iPad. It says I don’t have permission to at pins. HOW do I not have permission to add pins to a board I created from the account I’m logged into?!??! Only way to get it to work is to restart my device. There shouldn’t be this many bugs for a platform like this. SMH!!!

It also doesn’t registered that you switched counts so your boards don’t show. It just tells y9u to create a new board. So you either have to log out and back in or also restart your device along with the logging out and in. You just never know which process will work. So you have to keep trying until one of them works."
"Hi, Pinterest. I’ve used your app for a while now and I’ve done nothing but enjoyed the features. I am an iPhone user and I’m unsure if it has anything to do with the features, but I manage a group board and I no longer see the “activity” option? That was useful for me to connect with the members and pinners of the board, it being an anime board for all of our interests. If it isn’t too much I’d suggest a group message feature instead of 1 on 1. Group messaging or group dms would make it easier for collaborative boards and collaborative projects within the app. I know you guys stand out from various social media networking sites, but I feel it would really boost the efficiency of the app and help others like me who want to build a connection within a board. Overall the app is good, but I hope these features will be added and or fixed and my review is taken heed of. Thanks!"
"Okay, I'd love to know why every time you update this app, it seems to become more annoying.  Also, why is this the only app on my phone that I consistently have issues with?  It closes unexpectedly several times while using it, if I set my phone down while using it and come back after the screen has shut off to save battery, the app has closed and my search has to begin from scratch once more.  It freezes up a lot and, of course, closes after several minutes.  And for a long time I noticed it wasn't telling me that I had already pinned a pin, so now I'm finding that I have several repeat pins. Let's also add to this, the fact that I have turned off every notification setting possible and I STILL get a little red bubble with a number letting me know ""something"" has happened.  I don't care who my friends follow or who has liked a pin, seriously stop with the notifications! Please, for the love of all of our sanities, get you stuff together and make your app function properly, stop changing the few things that actually work well and start focusing improvements on the things that have been a consistent irritation for a long time now."
"A year or so ago was peek for this app. The home page was mostly pins from people you knew/followed, the inspiration/suggested content was applicable to your actual interests, the notifications were accurate and you could see which pins were saved, and the ads were minimal and less obvious. 

Now? It’s essentially unusable. There is never anything on my home screen that I am interested in and a majority of the content shown are ads; I don’t have a single recipe saved which includes meat, as I don’t eat animal protein, yet my homepage is overflowing with crockpot chicken recipes! If multiple pins are saved from the same board, even by different users, you can’t actually see what they’ve saved, instead it just says “4 pins from board x were saved”. Ridiculous! And the notifications are a complete joke! It shows me that I have 28, I look and only four are actually pins of mine that other users have saved, but I can’t actually see which pins those are, and the rest are “More ideas like your art board”. Or whichever board I’ve recently pinned to! UGH!!! Figure it out or it’s yet another deleted app."
"I came here to write a review and below is the review I wrote at some time in the past. I generally love Pinterest. However, the ads are getting out of control and I’m sure will only get worse heading into the holiday season. I opened Pinterest this morning and literally half of what I’m seeing are ads. Over and over I say I don’t like ads for games, clothes, makeup, yet they continue to appear. I say I don’t like ads in general. They continue to appear. Pinterest is part of my morning routine, but that just may be changing. See my sad face :(

It seems the number of ads has greatly increased! I don't mind some ads, but some many of them are not relevant to me. I'm 62 years old, I don't need baby diapers. I am gluten free and have a board that makes that evident. I don't need ads for crackers, pizza, baked goods recipes, etc.  I don't drink, don't need alcohol ads. I have no boards related to fashion or style - quit with the clothing, makeup ads. You need a reason for hiding ads that says ""not relevant to me"" and then your app needs to become smarter about what it shows!!!"
"I've had Pinterest for years and love how organized and versatile the pins are. Unfortunately, the more you update it, the more dysfunctional it becomes. If I tap on a pin to see the article, it won't load and, on top of that, it will also sometimes freeze in between two pins. When I try to swipe side to side it throws me back ten or so pins and then freezes. It also has so many ads it's hard to scroll through (which is the “price” we pay for having a free app, so, can’t complain too much). I also miss the heart button. After planning a wedding with a shared board between my family and bridal party, I got a lot of feedback from them wondering if I even saw their pin. I wish that or something similar would come back. It would be pretty cool to have a way to create personal notes on pins without changing the description on the bottom. Pinterest is great, but it would make it a lot more user friendly to get the freezing to stop. Thanks for keeping it free though!"
"I’ve used Pinterest for so long - and I understand that when an app is free, the user is the product. You’re selling our data and you’re selling ads to us - totally get it. But first your ads started moving. Half the time they are stuck and just flash for me which is so terrible. Then your ad to content ratio flipped to almost completely ads or shopping pins or sponsored in some way. And now, you’ve got videos that play sound. Sound that I can’t seem to be able to turn off. Your ad content is just SO distracting on this platform than I can’t even use this in the way it’s intended. Not to mention everything you serve me is related to exercising or makeup or dieting. Which means I get on here to find inspiration for illustration projects and just end up finding messages about how I should lose weight and buy makeup. Totally incongruent to my actual values and interests - which you should know…given the amount of data you have on me. Never once have I pinned makeup. Never once have I pinned diets or food or workouts. So I finally deleted the app today. Sad day. But I just get annoyed and angry every time I’m on here."
"i love pinterest, it’s great and cool, but im giving it three stars because of how many freaking times it refreshes it just because i left the app for a second or checked my dms or something or other. for the love of god PUT A NOTIFICATION FIRST BEFORE IT REFRESHES ASKING IF WE ACTUALLY WANT TO. IM CRYING. please. i will only be happy if you make this update. i’m so sad, depressed even and on the brink of spiraling into extreme mental insanity. my life is completely ruined and i don’t know how i will go on if changes are not made! it really is not hard. a simple notification double checking if i’d like to refresh before it just completely changes my feed when i was eyeing a pin! i am NOT the only person who feels such. there is a great plethora of memes made by teenage girls complaining about this unfortunate disfunction , but do not be fooled with the silly laughing emojis for we are actually crying on the inside. this is not okay, you cannot treat your loyal customers as such. we want CHANGE and we want it NOW. i am DEPRESSED and it is quite literally YOUR FAULT!!! FIX IT!"
"I used to love Pinterest! Especially for home decor and recipes! But now I care a lot about rearranging boards in certain order, yet it gets scrambled up. I like my accounts boards and pins to look a certain way, but when I rearrange them the format gets crappy. And I don’t like the constant video advertisements because when I’m in Pinterest I enjoy listening to music at the same time but I can’t do that when an ad shows up. I remember when ads weren’t even on Pinterest. I miss that. I’m okay with short ads with pics instead of videos so it doesn’t mess up my music. But Pinterest please fix the reordering/rearranging the pins(I’m tired of putting a certain pin I want next to the other, but it end up under it or farther from it) please, it’d be a lot of help and I’d probably like the app extra more. Also, I’d like to go back to when I could search up board names of other profiles not just profile names. Also, better hashtags options."
"So i’ve been using pinterest for years and I absolutely love it. I have countless pins saved and even more than one account for all the interests I have! But there are a few recent updates that I haven’t be super happy with. The newest update is probably the worst, apps really need to stop trying to be like TikTok. We like your app the way it is, that’s why we use it. The new watch section with video pins is super weird to me, leave that kind of stuff for other apps, pinterest is perfect the way it is. Also, the pins where you can “stack” multiple images together is the absolute most annoying thing pinterest had ever added. I like being able to see one pin at a time without it skipping to the next really quick. 
I love pinterest, it is overall my favorite app. i just think it was perfect before the new updates were added. Anyway i hope anyone who reads this has a lovely day! :)"
"Pinterest is awesome!  And if you don’t already know about it then you are not.

Just kidding.....you are probably still awesome without Pinterest.......but if you get on Pinterest you can be just a little more awesomer! 😜 
And who doesn’t want to be a little bit more awesomer?!? 😉

Orrrrrrrrr it could make you a lot more awesomer, like it did for me!  Before Pinterest I was a total loser with nothing to do......now I’m a total loser with tons of stuff to do!  I mean all the DIYs!  

Haha!  Just kidding.... I’m not a total loser (I think 🤔)   Who knows?  Either way Pinterest has made my life a lot more fun!  I love the sharing of ideas!  And I feel like it inspires my mind to come up with new ideas too!  Who knew a simple little app could do that?!? 

 Anyway, ya, I love Pinterest.  My house loves Pinterest (it looks so much better ever since Pinterest came into my life 🙌🙌🙌). My kids love Pinterest (we do all the craft ideas....!).  My husband loves Pinterest (Foooooooood!).  I’m pretty sure even my dog loves Pinterest.  It’s an app for everyone!  😁

Just make sure you use it to it’s full potential (I’m lookin at you Mom 😆). (Ya my mom never pins anything, she just takes screen shots 🤷‍♀️ so then the app doesn’t get to know her preferences, and it can’t recommend stuff she would potentially really like. 😭  Don’t be like my mom!  Pin away you little pinners!  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do! 😁"
"I tried to make a business account while I had already had my personal account, and while I was setting it up and adding pins, it randomly signed me out of all the accounts I have. I could sign in to my personal, but my business one was lost with my only email logged into it. I tried sending them what had happened, and they haven’t responded, so I decided to just make a new one from scratch. Since I couldn’t use the same email address as the one I put in my first business account, I then had to make a new gmail. I signed up and was adding pins and boards, so I wanted to look it up on my normal account to see what it would look like if someone else viewed it. But when I looked it up, nothing was there. I tried looking up the name, email address, and even the titles of my pins and boards, but it wasn’t there. I looked at the gmail I had made and there was a message from Pinterest saying to confirm my password, so I put in the password I had just set up in gmail. It said it was incorrect, so I tried all of the other passwords I have ever owned, and non of them would work, and my account still won’t come up when I look it up."
"Hello tech people! Just want to say I love Pinterest, but I do have a couple of issues with it... #1 - WHY so many ads??? I realize this is a free app , but come on guys... the ads get to be overwhelming! And they are so totally not what I’m interested in so I hide them, over and over and over, it tells me I won’t see that same ad a gain, but it always pops up again, usually really soon!
#2 - This one is the REALLY annoying problem - when I zoom in on a pin to see details, it will lock up on me on the pin that I’ve zoomed in on, and it stays locked up for hours, sometimes even overnight!! I can’t get out of it no matter what I do, can’t access anything else until it decides it’s punished me long enough. Then it goes back to my home page and I can go on with what I was doing. I’ve even considered uninstalling it, but that truly will be the last resort. I would much rather you fix the problem, so I can continue to enjoy it. I truly hope you will see if you can alleviate this glitch. I really would hate to have to uninstall it!
Thanks for letting me sound off!"
"It’s funny how most of the reviews for Pinterest all discuss the same disappointment that most users feel. Why is everything changing? Why are there so many ads? Why is stuff showing up that I don’t care about? Why can’t I get inspiration from explore pages and NOT ads or “picked for you”? And Pinterest STILL doesn’t listen. You’d think with the amount of reviews by veteran users they’d take a hint and implement some of the older aspects that made Pinterest so enjoyable to use. The app isn’t user friendly. It’s hard to manage. I dont like any of the stuff “picked for me” if I’d known looking up something about dorms would clog my feed with dorm room stuff for the next three months, I wouldn’t have looked it up in the first place! I miss the explore page. The only real good thing left. Pinterest has become more and more unenjoyable and it’s disappointing that it seems like none of the developers care. 800+ comments on the Explore Page Removal pin expressing anger over it and still no consideration in what the people who spend their time on the app want. So much potential for this app that only seems to be going downhill."
"1) I don’t understand this apps block feature at all. The bare minimum for a blocking feature is to make it so you don’t see a user or their content again while they remain blocked and Pinterest doesn’t even ensure that. As far as I can tell the only thing it does is remove the blocked person from your sight if blocked through a comment but that’s not enough 🙃 I’m tired of being harassed because of fan art by people too young to be on the app anyway then not even be able to ensure I won’t see them or their pins again. 

2) Desperately needs more options for reporting users for breaking guidelines! The fact the only option to report a users account is spam is ridiculous. If someone admits to being too young or is obviously breaking rules it should be much easier to get them removed or at least checked out. Stop putting all your energy into removing “inappropriate” content that’s not actually breaking your rules 😒

3) The volume of ads these days is absurd and the targeted ads swing and miss so hard it’s genuinely funny when it’s not insulting 🤷🏻"
"Ok so this app is amazing, it would take me an hour to get to all the details. Pinterest is just amazing, I can find backyard ideas, bedroom ideas, lifestyles & more on ONE APP! You would never regret downloading it. Pinterest also has an inbox! You can tell your friends & family you have a new pin or ask them for ideas for a new pin or board! I personally like gardens and the aesthetic style, you could find recipes, crafts, drinks, and a lot more. I like instagram and twitter but this is beyond all of that, I honestly even recommend it for a 6 year old. You can gain followers and follow people, create digital art and screenshot then post it! Ok I think I said enough now, just if your reading this and don’t have Pinterest downloaded, download it right now and share it to everyone you know, you won’t regret it, if you download it it can change your day, week, month, year, or your life depending on how you use it."
"Out of all the years I’ve dealt with Pinterest’s glitches and bug problems, this by far is the most frustrating problem I’ve come to face so far. I’m not trying to sound dramatic, but this update is so upsetting. Here’s the problem: when I save a pin to one of my boards, it’s all fine and dandy. But then when I try to save another pin, it’s showing the previous boards I’ve opened. It doesn’t show any suggested boards like it used to. That means I have to scroll through my 50,000 boards just to save a measly pin, when it could be provided at the top when clicking the save icon. 

Another problem that I should mention are the lags I get when saving pins to my gallery. I scroll, I save, and a red notification pops up saying that there was an error in saving the pin to my gallery. So now I have to re-save the pin again. And when I go to my gallery, the same pin is saved TWICE in my gallery and I have to delete one of the two. I love this platform, but it’s starting to take the joy out of me scrolling through different ideas and things I like."
"Recently Pinterest has added the “Your Shopping List” boards to my profile- and it’s one of the most infuriating app updates I’ve ever had to deal with in my life. It’s right up there with Instagram’s ridiculous shopping updates. At one point, I had about 12 identical “Your Shopping List” boards on my page, and I could not get rid of them. Thankfully, this glitch has been fixed & there is now only one (1) “Your Shopping List” board on my page. But I still can’t stand it. I don’t come to Pinterest to shop. I am entirely uninterested in things being marketed to me in this way. I take my boards very seriously- they’re a mark of who I am and my aesthetic. I love spending time curating them. But every time I see that awful “Your Shopping List” board, I want to rip my hair out! If this were an optional feature, I would be on board (pun only mildly intended.) But as it is, I am at the end of my line. I hate that ugly little board. If I wanted to make a board of things I wanted to buy, I would do it myself."
"Everyone that views Pinterest is seeing the world in a new and innovative way. Leaving this app, especially if you are a donator will leave people without your knowledge. Yes it can be repetitive, but only because people leave, and in doing so, leave every noob who needs an expert one expert short.
This app would not be so repetitive if people would apply their own knowledge to it. As for seeing followers...I like being anonymous and still learning (although I didn’t mind being seen on pinterest). Either way, I am not so picky to see unrelated videos, just in case I didn’t realize that maybe it was of interest to me. I sometimes forget what I wanted to look up because I am busy with my baby and don’t jot the ideas or questions down as they unfold. Leaving Pinterest will undoubtedly leave a gap of possible learning that we all crave! That is why we have this app in the first place :) So all that are tired...please persevere. We need you!"
"Pinterest is not your friend. They want to control your thinking.
My grandmother had been on Pinterest for 5 years, over 200 boards and 6000 followers. She was notified of a sketch she had pinned from another pinner that is was not allowed. They deleted it. Ok that’s fine. Then she was notified of a copyright complaint and has no idea what is was about. A few days later her account was gone..no notice, nothing. Also be aware of the porn that is on Pinterest. Also Pinterest is censoring anything to do with natural medicine and the truth about vaccines. As I said they want to control your thinking! I seriously doubt if this gets in the reviews. It’s not their thinking...we will see. You are not smart enough to think or investigate the truth is what they are telling you. It’s their belief or hit the road. They just deleted my health board because they disagree with it. Also with every update it gets worse. It looks like a big unkept scrapbook, you have no idea what your looking at unless you click on it. Advertising is out of control...it’s ridiculous! This is my second time trying to make review, first one not excepted..had to edit it...let’s see if they censor this review."
"Pinterest was once the go-to place everyone went to for project inspiration and recipes. Now there are more ads than content and I am so tired of it. Don’t you realize you are deterring customers in a way that they’ll never return or even consider returning? You are pushing all of us into the arms of other developers who care about the usability and interface more than making a quick buck on ads. 

Pinterest is no longer a useful app. There are far more ads than content and that means that your features are useless and falsely advertised. Why do you continue updating this app when the updates are only making changes that make it not even usable? When someone clicks “see more like this” on a sponsored post your app shows ALL sponsored on the “more like this” page and most are completely unrelated, because it is showing the sponsored part as what we want to see more of. I use reddit far more and have barely used this app for months. 

You’re headed down the drain, Pinterest. You won’t listen to your users but your users are who keeps you making money. Priorities. Pinterest chooses ads over users."
"This site has given me so much info. Love the tutorials especially as even though I thought I was pretty good, I’m nothing compared to the talent I see on all the pages. I’m a third generation candle maker but I’ve learned so many different ways of making them look pretty and rustic. Things that I would never dreamed of. I would like to do a tutorial on just how to make them. They smell amazing and are 100% natural. You can eat them because I only use essential oils and wooden wicks and the soy. Not my momma or my grandma ‘s candles. Now I’ve learned how to make them pretty using any glass jar. Too many people to thank for that ! And since I know my daughter will have a barn wedding I can do such cool decorations and today I was looking at handmade flowers, again not what I learned in art class but with practice the barn is going to look amazing! I checked this site for everything from hair cuts to hair removal. This site rocks😊 U are all so talented I’m in awe of each of you ❤️.."
"Pinterest is a wonderful app for finding inspiration, passing time, getting ideas, or just winding down after a long day. I've spent many an hour on the app, whether it be useless scrolling or actually getting ideas and using them.

I have several issues, none too major that I can't get over or isn't fixed in time, except for one. The recommendations on the home feed.

For the most part, Pinterest is excellent at monitoring my interests and keeping my feed relevant, but sometimes it just goes buck wild. I never look at clothes, but it once recommended me a solid 5-minutes worth of looking trough pins of just sweatshirts. This is somewhat understandable, as sweatshirts are somewhat in my range of interest, but lately I've been getting constant academic and business paper recommendations. Whether it be email templates, letters of resignation, or college application forms, Pinterest won't stop. I hide each and every one of these pins for its irrelevance, but I keep getting them instead of the things I actually save and care about.

I understand that none of this is in any way major, but they are small things I've noticed and come to dislike.

Overall, the app is very useful and I spend a lot (too much) time on it. I would recommend Pinterest for really anyone, it has memes, wedding ideas, drawings, tutorials, and really anything you might need. Just beware of the hours you will spend on it.

--an absolute buffoon"
"Pinterest is a cool app, I like it a lot but it does have a good amount of problems. Like when you swipe down to your notification screen and it reloads the whole page, or when your playing music and it forcefully gets cut off by the ads, you can’t see your liked pins, it now no longer has each individual board name where you can save things to that one specific board, it refreshes wayyyy to much, its no reason for it to refresh as much as it does, we can’t use emoji’s while naming a board. When i’m in a board and i’m swiping down/ up it goes out the whole board it’s like to loose. When I exit out of one board that’s farther down on my screen it goes back to the top of my boards. Even if i’m still in the app but just not at the home page when I go to it, it still reloads. The ads are so overwhelming and irrelevant to me. Recently, Princess Diana has been showing up all over my home feed just because I clicked her picture one time?All these things make me not want to use the app"
"Running iOS 13.1.3 on an iPad. App resets to top if I switch between apps and return to Pinterest. Very annoying, as ALL my other pops will hold my place. If i wait too long to touch screen and iPad accidentally goes into sleep mode or i shut case to carry to different location, app will crash. App constantly freezes up on me (probably every 15 minutes or so) and requires me to shut down the app and reopen, effectively losing my place with what i was looking at...it is next to impossible to find these pins again. There also seem to be an inordinate amount of adds and i see almost nothing posted my my friends even though they pin a lot. I raised the rating my a star, though, bc the other problems i was having (not being able to access but 5 of my 55 boards) has been fixed. It is my dearest wish that Pinterest would stop making unnecessary changes to the app (there are usually some in each update that seem to be just for the sake of change) and to address actual problems with the app itself. If its working there’s no need to change it, if its broken please fix it."
"I still use Pinterest occasionally, but unfortunately I can no longer allow my children to sit with me while I search. While this used to be a fun activity for us together, so many of the ads are inappropriate selling bras, panties, swim suits etc and I don’t want my kids to see that.  Many of the exercise-type ads or pins even show women inappropriately dressed or in suggestive positions. I don’t want those images in my head, let alone my children. Every time I get an ad like that I click not to receive those ads anymore. I understand why Pinterest uses ads now, though it’s frustrating, but I wish they would not allow ads that are not family friendly. Also, I think over the years Pinterest has become increasingly horrible at filtering the daily feeds to be more relevant to my searches and what feedback I give when I purposefully click on something to STOP seeing those types of things."
"Pinterest is slowly dying. And there’s nothing you can do about it, TBH when I first got Pinterest, I really didn’t know what to expect. but I certainly didn’t expect to like it as much as I did, the ability to collect/publish and share pictures/gifs with friends. but making friends was not something I expected, and turned out to be one of the most appealing things about Pinterest. sad to say the old Pinterest I knew I loved, is long since gone. and has been slowly getting worse ever since then. If all you want to do is save pictures to boards, then Pinterest might not be bad for you, but for me somebody who likes to share pictures with friends, and talk about them, as well as make new friends, it’s been a hellish nightmare. and with each new update it gets worse (something I previously thought was impossible) being able to make friends from all around the world. then not being able to talk to them/share pictures, because Pinterest is so f###ing glitched out all the time! well if that sounds like a good time to you, then Pinterest is the app for you........ if not skip it."
"I love Pinterest and I’ve been using it for years but I’ve been facing this issue recently 
So when I’m scrolling through my board,
It suddenly jumps out if my finger is slightly towards the left and I find that so annoying because it keeps happening over and over again. It seems like the app cannot detect if I’m trying to scroll up or swipe, so it ends up jumping out of the board.
Another issue that isn’t quite recent is that my boards keep refreshing when I’m trying to tap on them and they change places so for example if I’m trying to tap on board 1, it suddenly refreshes and all the boards start changing their place and board 1 gets replaced by board 2 and I end up tapping on board 2. I just find it really annoying because I’m not even trying to refresh but it refreshes by itself.
Sometimes the app glitches and it gets stuck and I can’t tap on anything unless I completely close the app and reopen it and that is so frustrating because I lose the Pin I had spent hours to find. 
Another issue is some videos won’t play at first and I have to keep clicking on the Play button until it decides to play and overall it’s so laggy.
I hope I was able to explain them well enough for you to understand because English isn’t my first language.
It would be great if Pinterest fixed these issues. Other than that, this app is amazing and I will never stop using it."
"Pinterest is a great app that I love to use when discovering artwork or posts related to certain topics I like. The app itself is, in my opinion, wonderfully designed and I haven’t had any performance issues so I have no complaints there. Recently however, (and I am by no means blaming this on the Pinterest team) I have been seeing some questionable posts appearing on my feed. The posts in specific are photos meant to look like videos, so that the viewer is tricked into clicking on them. What I mean by this is that a play button will be over the image, but it won’t actually be able to play so that when you click on it thinking it will play the video it just takes you to a phishing site instead saying something like “congrats!!! You’re Pinterest’s 10 millionth user” or something like that. Just something I think the Pinterest team should look into to protect the privacy of their users. Other than that, amazing app! :)"
"I love the amount of content I can search through, but I almost always have to search. Before all the big updates (some of which are good) my home page feed would show me things my friends shared, or things based on my likes. Now it almost always is flooded with things “picked for me”, but those things, if at all, rarely reflect what I actually search. OR on the other extreme, ALL of my home page feed will be based on one search. I wish we could go back to the basics with this to where I was seeing things my friends pinned which were usually things of a common interest. It made it more of a social media outlet and less of a search engine. 

One feature I LOVE which I think is great is the button that will pull up related pins if you see something you like. Definitely my favorite feature! If I could use this feature on my desktop instead of just in the app that would be awesome. I think I use my desktop to browse as much as I use the app!"
"This app is amazing and you could use it for so many things, however I think that updates/changes are unnecessary when the app was originally so good. One thing that I find annoying is how if I have a board of (let’s say for example) a celebrity, and then I go to add a picture of said celebrity to that board, it suggests quite literally every other single board I have first before suggesting the one it so obviously is meant to go in. This issue happens with all of my boards, if I want to save a picture of a bathroom, it suggests a clothing board, and I find it extremely annoying, because it makes the saving pins process so much longer. The app is amazing overall, and I strongly suggest it either way, it’s just a small bug I wish they could fix.
Also, please bring back the all pins board, so unnecessary to remove it, and why do ads play loudly now, even with ringer turned off? I can’t listen to music and be on this app without it being interrupted every 5 seconds :/ extremely disappointing."
"Lot’s of little glitches throughout the app. Sometimes it just freezes & I have to wait it out (can’t close the app & open it up again because it will still be frozen on the same screen) until it finally closes on its own. Other times I’ll click to read the comments but their won’t be a “Back Button” so I have to close the app in order to get out of those comments.
These mentioned glitches can be quite frustrating to deal with, However, I still love the website itself. This site has allowed me to expand my horizons in so many ways such as more recipes I’ve found that have been staples in our home, from DIY crafts to DIY furniture, workout routines, etc. & all while keeping ideas in their designated Boards so you can some back time & time again to the specified Pin.
So like my Caption says, love the website but not exactly a fan of their app. They can do better about fixing these glitches so us users can have a smooth experience."
"I had no problems with the Pinterest mobile app for iOS until this last release. The only thing I can’t do anymore is see the summary detail  data on the notifications page. For example, I go to the notifications page and see that 9 pins were saved from one of my boards, I click on that to see which pins were saved and it takes me to a second page that just shows me a lot of pins and no detail data of exactly which pin it was that was saved.  If I scroll up it takes me back to the notifications page and if I scroll down it takes me through all the pins of the other pinners that saved my pin.  It used to show me the pin that was saved and the boards it was saved to.  I’d really like to see which pens were saved and not just pictures of the different boards of other pinners that it was saved to.  I’ve already done all the maintenance like clearing my cache, deleting the app and reinstalling the app, etc. and it hasn’t done any good. Maybe I’m missing something?"
"Used to love Pinterest and could lost in it for hours. No longer. I get frustrated by ads, irrelevant content, too much of one thing or spam/porn sites within ten minutes of being in the app. I do not use this as a social platform at all; I only use it to find recipes and look for certain things. I loved the overall trending page it used to have, and then you could go into ""food"", and still have trending recipes. I know the trending pages are still there but they work nothing like how they used to. Also don't like how they look! Go back to old views please! Reading some of the other reviews, it looks like these changes are frustrating to a lot of people. So disappointed! 

Previous Review:
Like others, I love love love this app, but it crashes a lot and reloads same results on ""popular"" tab all the time. I use this app a lot, but I would enjoy it more if all the kinks got worked out. I've used it for about two years now. It's easily to get addicted to Pinterest and therefore I deal with all the mini-issues! :-)"
"I started a new account recently and followed topics I liked. Something major is wrong. it no longer lets me swipe to see the next pin and does not let me see the comments or tried tab. The worst is that the topics are not showing material that relates to it.... at all. Some of the topics I followed are gadgets (now unfunny cat memes that I have shown no interest in at all), technology (now, random...anime?), and fallout (now anything that has any slight relation to gaming, random comics, or Marvel and DC.) Another quick thing to point out is the increase in ads and buyable items. Please fix these issues.

Edit: I am DONE using your service! I used to enjoy it, back when the updates actually helped. I tried to close my account so I could start a new one where the service might be less buggy! The problem is that it tries to force me to reactivate my account with that same email. So do I have to start a whole new email account to have new profile on your service?! It’s official: I have deleted the pinterest app and closed my account. To newcomers: enjoy having no like button, no ability to swipe, and no option to view comments."
"Nice app in general, but there are a couple of changes that need to happen ASAP to make this app usable. Give users the option to turn off automatic home feed reloading. Hop to another app for a minute? The home screen auto refreshes when you return. Navigate to a different screen in the app for .2 seconds? The home feed refreshes. Blink? Auto refresh!! This still happens even when I turn off background app refresh on iOS. Secondly, I don’t know if the “save to profile” feature is still being tested, but seeing this feature pop up again for me is like getting a summons for jury duty. I don’t want it. It’s not good. Worst of all, it takes me MORE time to simply save a pin. Under no circumstances am I going to go back into a different board that I don’t want and didn’t ask for to organize pins that I simply could’ve organized into the proper board when I first saw it. At least give users the option to turn it off completely. In general, giving users control over different app features would make this app much better than it is."
"Pinterest has change from when I started an account 9 years ago.  While I still enjoy a scroll thru.  A recent issue really was disappointing on how customer service can help.  Even though I had my user name and non working email address used to start my account, tech support wasn’t able to help retrieve my account. Yes, my error in not remembering that my email was so old.  But, with apple products never needed it to open account.  With new devices all passwords had to be reset manually.  6 emails to customer service with no assistance, basically saying.  Sorry your out of luck.  I eventually spent 2 hours digging an old hard drive out of my garage and turned it on to get access to my boards and followers.  Yes, got email reset and updated password.  Hopefully tech service will figure out how to allow for more account resets with other personal info.  And with all the ads now so prevalent on all recipes etc.  it’s no longer a go to for recipes.  Easier off of Instagram."
"I have loved Pinterest for years but this app keeps getting glitchier and glitchier. Every time I see an update I hope for the best but have been disappointed that it isn’t fixing the problems. Constantly freezing every few pins I look at. The cursor bar isn’t working correctly and I can’t tap and change anything at all (it just snaps back to the beginning of the line no matter how I select.) Have to delete and start typing over ever time. Truly annoying if you want to change or tweak a search slightly or just have a typo. I can’t even count how many times the app has totally frozen and had to be fully shut down...yes I’ve tried restarting the iPad as well as fully swiping up to close the app and starting over. Yes, I have checked and made sure there are not a crazy amount of apps open. Yes I have checked and I have more than plenty of available memory. No matter what I do it just shuts down and happens again a few pins later. I used to enjoy this app but now it’s a painful time waster.  If we weren’t in the middle of a renovation and I didn’t already have an inspiration board set up I would have totally abandoned this app."
"Somehow the app gets worse with every update. Recent issues include: when I check my notifications, I get locked on that screen. I have to go to my DMs, tap my own icon to view my profile, and tab back to my home feed. The algorithm is an embarrassment, and there's no following feed, which? Feels like most of what the website was about? Also, why the sudden influx of dessert-flavored cocktails? I've never once even thought about wanting one. I literally don't drink. Where is this coming from? Add that to frequent crashes, unwanted refreshes, and technical issues, and the novelty of the app is overshadowed by how overwhelmongly bad it is. 

Honestly? I remember being a teenager in high school wondering what Tumblr was thinking when they rolled out disliked or controversial updates, but even now as an adult I'm more stupefied by your single-minded determination to run your app directly into the ground. I've got some boards I've had for years that I'm attached to, but This Is Abysmal. Please you don't even have to fix it just stop making it WORSE"
"The app still provides as much helpful and unique content as ever, it’s just almost equally as disappointing that now whenever you are on the app and go to anything else on your phone (respond to a message, not touch the screen and let the phone lock, or leave the app to do anything else) the app starts over with the question of which country I am in, despite the fact that I have it SET to the United States in my settings and that’s always the default anyway when it pops back up. The bad part is it does not save where I was, often I have to go back to recent searches and try to click previous pins in the exact same order to get back to the one I was last on, could you guys PLEASE change or fix this. As wonderful as the app is it almost makes it not worth it to get on because I know when I get on Pinterest I have to ignore everything else and cannot let my screen go off or else I’ll have to start over to get back to where I was! And this started a few months ago after updating the app I HATE it"
"Somehow my daughter's app updated before mine and she warned me that it was bad. Since I didn't know how to turn off the automatic update, I left it alone thinking, ""It can't really be THAT bad!"" Alas, it really is THAT bad. I can't imagine ANYONE enjoying the new set-up where you can't see who pinned what. It's the entire reason Pinterest is considered social media. If we can't tell who pinned what, it completely removes the ""social""'part. If it's not remedied very soon, I too will quit using the app. I have never written a review before, but I felt compelled...because yes, it really is THAT bad...

UPDATE
Thank you for returning the lost feature and allowing us to see who is pinning what...now...you have added the “following” tab, which would be really great, except that it seems to be exactly the same as the “home” tab because it’s still full of a bunch of pins from people you’ve never heard of. So fix that, and people can go back to enjoying pins from people they chose to follow or from your suggestions. Choice is always appreciated."
